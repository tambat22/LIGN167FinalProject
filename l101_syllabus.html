<ul>
<li><p><strong>Syllabus/Course Website:</strong> <a
href="https://savethevowels.org/101"
class="uri">https://savethevowels.org/101</a>, Slides are linked below
in the Course Schedule.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Podcast:</strong> Course videos will be posted after
lectures on Canvas under ‘Media Gallery’, and potentially also at <a
href="http://podcast.ucsd.edu" class="uri">http://podcast.ucsd.edu</a>.
Note that podcasts are a bonus, not an obligation, and I can’t guarantee
podcasts for every session due to technical issues, so skip class at
your own risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Canvas:</strong> This course will be using Canvas for
discussions, to post course content, files, and to manage grades. Should
you need any technical assistance with Canvas, please send an email to
canvas@ucsd.edu.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discord:</strong> By popular demand, the course has a
Discord server for chat, discussion, asking questions, sharing of
linguistics memes, and the finding and interacting with study partners.
The invite link is posted on Canvas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gradescope:</strong> We’ll be using <a
href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a> for homework and quiz
submission this quarter. Once you’ve created an account <em>using your
<span class="citation" data-cites="ucsd.edu">@ucsd.edu</span> email
address</em>, you’ll be able to see the course, as well as to upload
your assignments. If you have any problems with this process, please
alert your instructor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zoom:</strong> We’ll be using Zoom in case any class
sessions or office hours must be conducted online. For any class-related
Zoom work, please follow <a
href="http://wstyler.ucsd.edu/onlinestudents/">Will’s Student Guidelines
for Online Classes</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>WebClicker:</strong> This quarter, for getting instant
feedback and measuring participation (‘clicking in’), we’re going to use
<a href="https://webclicker.web.app/"
class="uri">https://webclicker.web.app/</a> via your own device. This
service is in development still, but replaces the $60+ iClicker devices
in your budget, so I hope you’ll bear with us in testing to make sure
this is ready to go. The course registration code is
<strong>FBPURC</strong>, please make a (free) account and register for
this class using that code. Please make sure to accurately input your
student ID, so we can match your scores to your self, even when students
share names.</p></li>

Study Guide</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h3>
<p><strong>Course Textbook:</strong> For students who would like an
accompanying textbook, I’ll recommend <em>An Introduction to
Language</em> by Fromkin, Rodman and Hyams, as it is the best and
clearest introductory text available to the field right now. Different
chapters of the book will correspond to our lecture themes pretty
straightforwardly, and you can get some additional information by
reading them, if you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: Given the textbook’s price, this
book is <strong>optional, and all readings are recommended, but not
required</strong>, and no exercises from the book will be assigned. The
11th Edition (ISBN: 978-1337559577) is currently in press,
<em>however</em>, given the book’s pricing, I <em>highly encourage</em>
you to find the book used or in an electronic format, and the 9th and
10th US Editions are perfectly fine as written companions to the course
material (ISBN: 978-1-4282-6392-5 (9th) and 9781133310686 (10th)). We
will not be using the Cengage ‘Digital Platform’ or any of the add-ons,
so please <strong>do not</strong> buy digital content ‘bundles’ or any
such other upsells.</p>
<p>I’m also working with the library to put a few copies on reserve, so
you should be able to access it there as well, provided you’re not
waiting until the last minute.</p>

<p>For each week, you’ll have in class learning sessions Tuesday and
Thursday, as well as an assigned ‘Discussion Section’ which will allow
you to engage directly with the material. All assignments are due on
Sundays following the class session at 11:59pm (so Week 1’s ‘Due Sunday’
assignment is due on the Sunday before Week 2, at 11:59pm). <em>In

<h2 id="student-resources-for-support-learning-and-interaction">Student
Resources for Support, Learning, and Interaction</h2>
<p>Please see my <a href="http://wstyler.ucsd.edu/resources/">complete
listing of student resources</a> for information on student support
(e.g. counseling, crisis centers, resource centers), resources for
learning (libraries, writing help, and more), resources for engaging
with faculty (e.g. Coffee with a Prof, Letters of recommendation), and
technical resources.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>As this class is a large survey course, the goal is to build
familiarity with facts about languages, terms which reflect your more
linguistic understanding of Language, and with analytical techniques and
skills like IPA transcription, phonological analysis, and building
syntactic constituency trees.</p>
<p>A more granular list of terms, skills, and questions you should be
able to answer by the end of the class can be found in <a
href="https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/docs/l101_study_guide.html">the course
study guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="effort-matters">Effort Matters!</h2>
<p>In all of my classes, teaching is a collaborative process, and my
goal is straightforward: I want to help students who put in strong
effort to get a great grade.</p>
<p>So, you will succeed in this class if you…</p>
<ul>
<li>Attend scheduled course meetings, and watch recordings or talk to
your IAs if you miss sessions</li>
<li>Pay attention to the schedule and start on assignments early, in
part so you can…</li>
<li>Come to office hours to ask any questions</li>
<li>Practice effective self care, look after your physical and mental
health, and <a href="http://wstyler.ucsd.edu/resources/">take advantage
of student resources</a></li>
<li>Reach out and let us know if something’s keeping you from doing your
work effectively ASAP
<ul>
<li>I’m <em>much more</em> likely to offer extensions and exceptions
before the due date than after the fact. We can work out documentation
later.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We will bend over backwards to help students who are sincerely doing
their best to succeed in this class, and will always do our best to help
students who are trying to recover, even after a rough start. And of
course, we’re also always happy to help when documentable circumstances
beyond your control come up which prevent you from making your full
effort.</p>
<p>That said, if you’re “blowing off” the class, skipping class,
starting assignments at the last minute, cutting corners, <a
href="https://savethevowels.org/gradechanges">grade begging, grubbing,
or lawyering</a>, or turning in low-effort and low-integrity work, it’s
disrespectful to me and the rest of the instructional team. As such, if
you make these decisions, you’ll find us much less eager to help,
accommodate, recommend, or make policy exceptions for you.</p>
<p>So, we’re on the same team, and we want to help you succeed, but the
key is demonstrating strong effort, and we’re going to put as much
effort into helping you succeed as you do.</p>
<h2 id="assessing-learning">Assessing Learning</h2>
<p>Your final grade is based on the below formula, and will be
automatically calculated in Canvas:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Item</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">% of Final Grade</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Homework Assignments</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">60%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Final Exam</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">20%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Section Participation</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">10%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Class Participation</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">10%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The grading scale used for this course is the <a
href="http://blink.ucsd.edu/go/grading">UCSD standard scale</a>, where
A+ is 97% or more, A is 96.99% to 93%, A- is 92.99 to 90%, B+ is 89.99
to 87%, and so forth. Plus and Minus grades are not assigned below “C”,
and no grade changes will be considered from A to A+. “Pass” is any
grade 70% or higher.</p>
<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>Homeworks will be submitted online through Gradescope, and you’ll
turn them before Midnight on the designated day(s). These will be
designed to test your understanding of the concepts and materials given
you, and to go beyond just reciting facts.</p>
<p>We will automatically drop your lowest homework. You will still be
responsible for knowing the material covered in any dropped
homeworks.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because we drop your lowest grade automatically, <strong>we won’t
accept late homework without prior arrangements</strong>, and no make-up
assignments are given. If you know you won’t be able to turn it in on
the due date, you can complete and submit it early or drop it like it’s
hot.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s wise to save your answers in a document on your own machine,
and copy-paste into Gradescope as you go, both so you can work offline,
and so that you’ve got an archive of your answers in case you
accidentally delete a response or the like. Also, please confirm your
answer submissions before the due date, as due to past students taking
advantage, we won’t be making grading exceptions for ‘omg gradescope
didn’t save my answers!’ or ‘I couldn’t access Gradescope!’.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if you collaborate with other people, your assignments
should be unique, and should reflect your own words and understanding.
Make sure your words, examples, and sentences are your own, even if you
worked with a group. Also remember that ‘checking answers’ with a study
group is as likely to make you choose a wrong answer as a right one, as
‘a person with two watches never knows what time it really is’.</p></li>
<li><p>To reflect the new world of Large Language Model (e.g. ChatGPT)
cheating, which is a <em>really</em> bad idea by which many will still
be tempted, student answers containing <em>completely false</em>,
<em>baseless</em>, or seemingly <em>confabulated</em> (made up from
nowhere) information or references will be heavily penalized. So, please
make sure you understand everything you’re writing, and if you’re not
clear on something, come talk to us in office hours!</p></li>
<li><p>All assignments are weighted equally and are equally
important.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h3>
<p>The final exam is meant to assess your learning of the concepts and
facts presented in the class. I hope that we will be in person such that
this will be an in-class exam, in the normal classroom and will count
for a large proportion of your final grade. Exams will be cumulative,
covering all material discussed to that point. My exam policies are
discussed at <a href="http://savethevowels.org/exam"
class="uri">http://savethevowels.org/exam</a>.</p>
<p>If serious (and documentable) reasons will prevent you from taking an
exam on the scheduled date, or if you will require specific
accommodations during an exam, <strong>you must contact the instructor
at least two weeks prior to each exam to request an exception.</strong>
Students who are unable to attend an exam for documentable good cause
reasons will be able to make up the exam via a <a
href="https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/oralexam/">synchronous oral exam</a>,
asking about and discussing material from the class and exam, via Zoom
or in person, with the instructor. Details on this process are available
<a href="https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/oralexam/">here</a>.</p>
<p>OSD Accommodation exams (e.g. 1.5x time, ‘own room’ or ‘reduced
distraction environment’) will be handled by the <a
href="https://tritontesting.ucsd.edu/">Triton Testing Center</a>. For
more details on how this process works, see <a
href="https://tritontesting.ucsd.edu/for-students/index.html">this
site</a>. If you have specific documented needs which you feel are in
conflict with this option or testing solution, or have an additional
accommodation which you feel requires different testing approach
(e.g. exams must be read aloud), please contact me by Week 3 of the
quarter.</p>
<h3 id="class-participation">Class Participation</h3>
<p>Interactive polling will be used in this course to make class more
interactive, to gauge your understanding, and to help reinforce key
concepts. Most lectures will contain some clicker questions, answerable
by clicking in. As this is meant for participation (rather than
evaluation), in this class, every answer you give, right or wrong, will
contribute equally to this grade.</p>
<p>More importantly, as clicking is meant to be participation focused
(rather than ‘taking attendance’), and as we want to discourage students
from attending class while ill, <strong>we will drop half of the total
clicker points possible</strong>. This means that you can still earn
100% for clicker participation if you miss half of the clicker points
(that is, of the total number of clicker points across all the lectures,
you can miss up to half). So, if you have a tech issue or miss class,
don’t worry about it, and no make-up clicking methods are available
without good cause. Note, though, that regular attendance when healthy
is a good way to show us effort, and earns our respect, and ‘clicking
in’ from home is considered an academic integrity violation. This should
be a very easy 10% of your grade to earn.</p>
<h3 id="section-participation">Section Participation</h3>
<p>This class features mandatory sections. The purpose of these
discussion sections is to work with and reinforce concepts and processes
described in Lecture in LIGN 101. As such, the key to success is active
participation. As such, you will be awarded a single point of
participation grade each day you are present and participating in
section. Again, to discourage people from coming to class sick and to
avoid having to sort through requests for excused absences, <strong>we
will drop up to five missed days of section participation</strong>.</p>
<p>It is entirely up to the IA’s discretion whether you are awarded your
participation grade for a given session. To make sure you’re given full
points, you would be wise to…</p>
<ul>
<li>Attend your scheduled section (obviously)</li>
<li>Arrive on time, and leave when the section is dismissed</li>
<li>Show up healthy, awake, clear-headed, and ready to dig into language
data!</li>
<li>Participate actively in group work or breakout rooms</li>
<li>Ask questions, whether of your groupmates or your IA, whenever they
come up</li>
<li>If your scheduled section occurs on a university holiday, please try
to attend another, or visit one of us in office hours to discuss the
material covered.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to change the section you’re attending, please email the
IA whose section you’d like to switch into and ask for permission. As
they are often limited by room size, their ‘yes’ or ‘no’ is final.</p>
<h3 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h3>
<p>There are two ways to get extra credit for this class:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For this class, you can earn half a percentage point (0.5%) added
to your final grade by visiting the office hours of a member of the
instructional team (Will, or any of the IAs) sometime before week 7.
This can be to get a course content question answered or to discuss a
homework, or, if meeting with Will, simply to introduce yourself and
discuss some element of your linguistic interests or scholarly future.
<strong>To claim this extra credit, you must submit the canvas “Extra
Credit” quiz on Gradescope <em>within 24 hours of your
visit</em></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can earn one percentage point of extra credit for your final
grade by participating in one credit of Linguistics, Psychology or
Cognitive Science experiment. Sign up here:<a
href="http://ucsd.sona-systems.com/"
class="uri">http://ucsd.sona-systems.com/</a>. Do not wait until the
last week to participate, there may not be experiments available! The
last week to fulfill this requirement is Week 9, so get on it! <a
href="http://www.psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/sona/index.html">Detailed
Instructions are here</a></p>
<ul>
<li>If you would prefer not to participated in a SONA experiment, you
may write a one page (single spaced) summary of an experimental study
from an academic journal related to this class and submit it directly to
Will by email by Week 7. Your goal is to distill this paper into a more
digestible form, with particular focus on the reason for the study, the
findings of the study, and what we, as a field, have learned from it.
Email this to your instructor along with a copy of the paper you
chose.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Before asking for ‘additional extra credit’ or other course
exceptions, please see my page on <a
href="https://savethevowels.org/gradechanges">student requests</a> to
get a sense of what kinds of requests are welcome, and which are
unlikely to be received well.</p>
<h2 id="attendance-and-modality">Attendance and Modality</h2>
<p>It is very important that you attend class and section, and thus,
<strong>you will not be able to earn all the points in the class without
attending class and section</strong>, because the work you do in section
is important, and it’s better to do work with others and with a TA to
help. ‘Hybrid’ options sound great in theory, but add a great deal of
technical complexity, disadvantages those stuck at home, and in
practice, ‘hybrid’ is the very best way to make the experience worse for
two groups of people at once.</p>
<p>That said, in recognition of the variety of issues we face in these
Times, I am giving exceptional flexibility and amounts of ‘dropped’
missed class.</p>
<p>I am also willing to work with students for whom the attendance
requirement is particularly difficult due <strong>documentable
circumstances outside of your control</strong> (this means things like
medical problems, family tragedies, housing issues, or other
documentable serious ‘good cause’ issues, rather than overlapping
courses or scheduling conflicts). Please reach out to Will ASAP if you’d
like to request such accommodations.</p>
<h3 id="remote-instruction-preparedness">Remote Instruction
Preparedness</h3>
<p>In the event of a mandatory pivot to remote learning whether
generally, or in our course specifically, you will receive a formal
notification codifying any changes which need to be made, and this
syllabus will be updated. Changes made <strong>may</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lectures moving to an online modality, which will also be posted as
videos on YouTube, for those who need to watch asynchronously</li>
<li>Webclickers will be used to capture responses remotely, too.</li>
<li>Discussion sections will continue to meet as scheduled, but will do
so remotely via Zoom, using breakout rooms to facilitate group work,
with participation continuing to be mandatory.</li>
<li>Homework submission and due dates will not change, as this process
is already fully online.</li>
<li>Any exam(s) scheduled during a remote period will be completed as
online-submission ‘take home’ exam(s) conducted using Gradescope, during
the designated times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I reserve the right to make additional changes as the
circumstances merit, I do not anticipate that the overall course
schedule, assignment/exam due dates, nor final grade calculation will
change.</p>
<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>
<h3 id="masking-illness-and-participation">Masking, Illness and
participation</h3>
<p>The use of a campus-policy-approved face mask covering your mouth and
nose is <strong>optional</strong> in this class, per current university
guidance. Although I will teach unmasked for speech perception and
accessibility, students are very welcome to continue wearing a mask in
the classroom, and their choice to do so should be respected. If you do,
please make an effort to talk more loudly, given the difficulties of
masked speech.</p>
<p><strong>If you or somebody in your life feels sick, shows signs of
illness, or is diagnosed with COVID or another communicable illness, DO
NOT attend class, section, or in-person office hours until you have been
tested and cleared</strong>. Policies above dictate that you can miss
massive amounts of class without penalty or documentation, so when in
doubt, stay home.</p>
<p>I will not ‘respect you for powering through’, I will be disappointed
that you’ve endangered the class, so please, don’t hesitate to use those
days off (although you will still be responsible for understanding and
reviewing the work on your own).</p>
<h3 id="asking-questions-and-student-hours">Asking Questions and Student
Hours</h3>
<p>You are highly encouraged to join student hours (often known as
‘office hours’) or help sessions to ask content questions, ask for
clarifications about assignments, to ask for more information on a
subject that interests you, or to get help on homeworks. Helping you
learn this material is quite literally our job, so having students in
office hours is no inconvenience.</p>
<p><strong>Do not email us course content or homework
questions!</strong> If you have a question about course material, post
it on Canvas, such that everybody can benefit from the answers (because
chances are, they’re struggling in the same places). Adminstrative
questions (or questions you’d like to discuss in private) should still
be sent to the instructor via email.</p>
<h3 id="re-grading-policy">Re-grading policy</h3>
<p>If you feel that a grade has been assigned in error you should
<strong>submit a regrade request via Gradescope</strong> in an e-mail to
the Instructor (wstyler@ucsd.edu) ccing your TAs.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Check my <a href="https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/gradechanges">Grade
Change Guidelines</a> before you submit your request, to make sure it’s
a kind of grade change we can approve.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You must submit your request within seven days of that
particular assignment being returned/released</strong>. All grades more
than seven days old are final, erroneous or not, and all
previously-released grades will become final on the morning of the final
exam.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that you’ll want to look over every assignment as soon as
it’s given back, so that any possible errors can be addressed, and so
that you’ll learn from any mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Although you’re welcome to form study groups to discuss questions and
help each other out with understanding the material, you should be the
only person working on your copy of your assignment, and every answer
should reflect your own learning and work. Please, don’t be a cheater,
for your sake and ours, and refer to the UCSD policy below for more
information. Remember, you can always retake a failed class, but you
can’t make an academic integrity violation disappear.</p>
<h3 id="respectful-discussion-policy">Respectful Discussion Policy</h3>
<p>Examining language and languages inevitably leads to discussions of
gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, politics, nationality, etc.
Opinions are welcome, but all students must be mindful and respectful of
others in the class. Speak with others using respectful and kind
language, just as you’d like them to do with you, and focus your
discussion on the ideas, rather than individuals. Finally, remember that
as we discuss and evaluate our conversations, the focus will be on the
impact on an individual or group, not the intention or motivation of the
actor.</p>
<h3 id="special-accommodations-policy">Special accommodations
Policy</h3>
<p>All requests for special accommodations must be brought to the
instructor in the first two weeks of class, ideally sooner. This
includes things like religious holidays, university-sponsored events,
athletic schedules, conflicts with exam dates, and OSD accommodations.
Because running a big course is quite complex, if I don’t find out about
it in the first two weeks, I may not be able to help.</p>
<h3 id="late-add-policy">Late Add Policy</h3>
<p>Students adding the course after the course has begun will be held to
the same standards as their classmates, and graded according to the same
scale. In addition to being responsible for knowing material from past
assignments and sessions, the following policies apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Missed participation will be counted as zeroes, and dropped
according to course policy.</p></li>
<li><p>Any assignments <em>which have not been graded and released to
the class</em> may be completed and submitted for full credit within one
week of joining the class.</p></li>
<li><p>Assignments which have already been graded and released cannot be
made up, but remember that we drop the lowest of some of these types of
score, and that ‘zero’ will qualify as such.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you’ve joined sufficiently late as to wind up with zeroes even
after the dropped assignments, contact the instructor ASAP to formulate
a plan to make up the work you’ve missed.</em></p>
<h3 id="other-course-policies">Other Course Policies</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Please keep your responses and examples in homework and exams
kind, lighthearted, non-violent, and PG-13 unless specifically
discussing more adult language (e.g. swearing or a new word for a more
adult concept).</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not for ‘censorship’, but for compassion for the variety of
people who might read or grade your responses. Feel free to talk about
all of language, but there’s no need to be dark, ‘edgy’, or to introduce
adult themes when you’re just giving an example sentence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We will gladly honor your request to be addressed using your
preferred name or gender pronoun in cases where it differs from that on
the course roster. Please let us know quickly, remind us often, and
accept our apologies if we forget.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’d ever like a letter of recommendation or reference from
me, make sure to interact in class, come to office hours regularly, ask
great questions, make an impression, and take more classes from me
later. Even if you do <em>great</em> in the class, if I don’t know you
well, I’ll be a bad choice to write for you, and I have a policy of not
writing weak letters. More details at <a

<li><p>Will will unabashedly use as many really awful puns as possible
given the course content. If you have a pun allergy, run. Flee. Escape.
There is still time!</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you call an alligator in a vest? An investigator.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Information contained in the course syllabus, other than the
grading policies, may be subject to change, as deemed appropriate by the
instructor.</p></li>

<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<p>Students requesting accommodations for this course due to a
disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA)
letter issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD) which
is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. Students are
required to present their AFA letters to Faculty (please make
arrangements to contact me privately) and to the OSD Liaison in the
department in advance so that accommodations may be arranged.</p>
<p>Contact <a href="https://disabilities.ucsd.edu/">the OSD</a> for
further information - <a href="mailto:osd@ucsd.edu"
class="email">osd@ucsd.edu</a> | 858.534.4382</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity-1">Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Each student in this course is expected to abide by the <a
href="https://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-%20Manual/Appendices/2">UC
San Diego Policy on Integrity of Scholarship</a> and to <a
href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/excel-integrity/index.html">excel
with integrity</a>. Any work submitted by a student in this course for
academic credit will be the student’s own work.</p>
<p>Academic dishonesty (actions like cheating, plagiarism, aid of
academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, blackmail, bribery, and
threatening behavior) will generally result in poor recall and learning
of the material, and aren’t acceptable at UCSD. In cases of academic
dishonesty, possible in-class academic sanctions can include anything
from a zero on the assignment/test/project in question, to a blanket
lowering of your final grade by X%, to an assigned and non-negotiable
grade of “F” in the course. These sanctions are assigned at the sole
discretion of the instructor, and as every case is unique, additional
sanctions not listed above may apply. But again, remember that doing the
assignments honestly is a part of the learning process, and failure to
do so will hurt you more than anybody else.</p>

<h3 id="religious-accomodation">Religious Accomodation</h3>
<p>It is the policy of the university to make reasonable efforts to
accommodate students having bona fide religious conflicts with scheduled
examinations by providing alternative times or methods to take such
examinations. If a student anticipates that a scheduled examination will
occur at a time at which his or her religious beliefs prohibit
participation in the examination, the student must submit to the
instructor a statement describing the nature of the religious conflict
and specifying the days and times of conflict.</p>
<p>For final examinations, the statement must be submitted no later than
the end of the second week of instruction of the quarter. For all other
examinations, the statement must be submitted to the instructor as soon
as possible after a particular examination date is scheduled.</p>
<p>If a conflict with the student’s religious beliefs does exist, the
instructor will attempt to provide an alternative, equitable examination
that does not create undue hardship for the instructor or for the other
students in the class.</p>
<h3 id="discrimination-and-harrassment">Discrimination and
Harrassment</h3>
<p>The University of California, in accordance with applicable federal
and state laws and university policies, does not discriminate on the
basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender, gender
identity, gender expression, pregnancy (including pregnancy, childbirth,
and medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth), physical or
mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, ancestry,
marital status, age, sexual orientation, citizenship, or service in the
uniformed services (including membership, application for membership,
performance of service, application for service, or obligation for
service in the uniformed services). The university also prohibits
harassment based on these protected categories, including sexual
harassment, as well as sexual assault, domestic violence, dating
violence, and stalking. The nondiscrimination policy covers admission,
access, and treatment in university programs and activities.</p>
<p>If students have questions about student-related nondiscrimination
policies or concerns about possible discrimination or harassment, they
should contact the Office for the Prevention of Harassment &amp;
Discrimination (OPHD) at (858) 534- 8298, ophd@ucsd.edu, or <a
href="reportbias.ucsd.edu">reportbias.ucsd.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Campus policies provide for a prompt and effective response to
student complaints. This response may include alternative resolution
procedures or formal investigation. Students will be informed about
complaint resolution options.</p>
<p>A student who chooses not to report may still contact CARE at the
Sexual Assault Resource Center for more information, emotional support,
individual and group counseling, and/or assistance with obtaining a
medical exam. For off-campus support services, a student may contact the
Center for Community Solutions. Other confidential resources on campus
include Counseling and Psychological Services, Office of the Ombuds, and
Student Health Services.</p>
