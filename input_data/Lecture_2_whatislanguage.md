# What is Language?

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---

### Today's Plan

- Who are you?

- What is Language?

- What are some characteristics of Language?

- How Universal is Language?

- What *isn't* language?

- Does our language shape our thoughts?

---

# Who are you?

---

### Information I'd like

- Year
- Major
- What languages do we speak?

---

# What is Language?

---

### Language

- Language is a system for linking expression to meaning

- ... but we're probably better off thinking about what makes language, language-like

---

# What characteristics does Language have?

---

### Three important characteristics of Language

- 1 - Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified

- 2 - Fully Productive and Creative

- 3 - Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

---
### Characteristic #1

## Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified

---

### Language has 'signs' and 'signified' concepts

- The 'sign' is something a human does in communication

- The 'signified' is something in the world (conceptual or concrete)

- *What is the link between these things?*

---

### Non-arbitrary signs

- *The sign is causally linked to the signified*

- Smoke is a sign of fire

- Bleeding from your finger is a sign of a papercut

- Will's presence is a sign of bad puns 

---

### Iconic (or representational) signs

- *A referential abstraction from the signified* 

- # ‚òÇ ‚òÉ ‚òÄ üí© ü§¶‚Äç 

- Some hand gestures

- Some sounds meant to 'mimic' the world
 
---

<img class="big" src="img/curve.jpg">

---

### Arbitrary Signs

- *Referential only by agreement and widespread knowledge*

- Non-representational symbols (or uses of symbols) (‚ôÑ, üçÜ, üçë)

- Non-iconic gestures

---

![](img/scotland_speedsign.jpg)

- "Go whatever speed is legal here"

---
			 
### üî• in 'omg he started a üî• in his trashcan' is ...

A) Non-Arbitrary, Iconic

B) Arbitrary

### üî• in 'omg he started a üî• in his trashcan' is ...

A) <correct>Non-Arbitrary, Iconic</correct>

B) Arbitrary

---

### üî• in 'omg that party was üî•  üî•  üî• ' is ...

A) Non-Arbitrary, Iconic

B) Arbitrary

### üî• in 'omg that party was üî•  üî•  üî• ' is ...

A) Non-Arbitrary, Iconic

B) <correct>Arbitrary</correct>

---

### The most important arbitrary signifiers are...

---

## Words!

- The connection between words and meanings in language is (mostly) arbitrary

---

			  
### The connection between sound and meaning is mostly arbitrary in spoken Language

---

### Signed languages have arbitrary signs too!
(These ASL examples are from [Sign with Robert on GIPHY](https://giphy.com/signwithrobert/))

### ... but there are often elements of iconicity in signs

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/asl_dead.gif">

---

### Spoken language has moments of iconicity too!

---

### Onomatopoeia

*Words which, when spoken, sound kind of like the things they represent*

* (See also the idea of an [Ideophone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideophone))

---

### Onomatopoetic Words in English

Boom   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Gurgle   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Woof   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Snip   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Whoosh   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Splash  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Onomatopoeia differs across languages 
		
---

### A rooster says...

cock-a-doodle-doo (English)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

kukko kiekuu (Finnish)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

chicchirich√≠ (Italian)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

kuklooku (Urdu)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

kukuriku (Hungarian)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Sourced from [this awesome site](http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/personal/dabbott/animal.html)

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

(So, different languages can't even map sounds onto sounds uniformly)

---

### The best evidence for arbitrariness: Words differ across languages

- If the link between signifier and signified were non-arbitrary, *everybody would have substantially similar words for concepts*

---

### Spoiler Alert: We do not
<img class="r-stretch" src="img/fish_dieter.jpg">

---

### Characteristic #1

## Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified

---

### Characteristic #2

## Languages are fully productive and creative

---

### Let's test that out

- Let's describe an image that you've never seen before

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/stablediffusion_beach_san_diego_kitten_spaceship_silverware_motorcycle_dinosaur__by_Thomas_Kinkade_Seed-5923967_Steps-50_Guidance-14.jpg">

---

### This was not created by a human, so it doesn't follow human categories

- This was generated by [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion)

- The prompt was 'beach san diego kitten spaceship silverware motorcycle dinosaur by Thomas Kinkade'

- This is one of the weirdest natural language processing examples around!

	- **Yet we can still describe the output!**

---

### Languages are capable of describing anything (eventually)

- Might take time

- Might require some words to be 'circumlocuted' or invented

	- "I don't know a word for this, but I'll use other words to describe what I'm after'

- Might require incredible skill

	- "They should have sent a poet"

- But they'll get the job done

---

### Languages are also capable of producing an infinite set of unique sentences

- Any human speaker of a language can produce a sentence that nobody has ever spoken before

	- "I plan to buy a half-empty barrel of Doritos as soon as my penguin gets home with the Crown Jewels."

	- "I sure am glad that Michael Bay has agreed to direct a movie adaptation of my favorite childhood cartoon"

---

### ... and sentences can be infinitely grown and expanded

- I saw Anna.

- I saw Anna yesterday.

- I saw Anna yesterday before I refilled the hummingbird feeder.

- I saw Anna yesterday afternoon right after writing a bad pun but before I refilled the hummingbird feeder.

- I saw my neighbor Anna who likes to hug polar bears yesterday afternoon right after writing a bad pun but before I refilled the hummingbird feeder.

---

### This particular property is called recursion

- Sentences can be made to contain elements from other sentences infinitely

- "My cat saw the guy who went with Kati, Vincent, and Victoria to the park where the New York Knicks talked to Mary..."

- This can go on literally *forever*

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/hulkhoganfractal.jpg">

---

### Creativity and Productivity is true of all languages

- We have yet to discover a language which is communicatively 'primitive' or unable to describe reality

- If a language lacks elements, they will be developed or borrowed over time

- Languages can differ substantially still

- A given language may lack words for some concepts

	- ... or may have words that other languages don't have

	- Many words and concepts are culturally based, and may not be shared regardless

- **Every natural human language that we've found is able to express a rich set of meanings**

---

### Characteristic #2

## Languages are fully productive and creative

---

### Characteristic #3

## Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

---

### Grammaticality Judgements

- Some things sound 'like English' and are comprehensible

- Some things are not English

---

### You can make grammaticality judgements

- 'John went to the park with Tamara'

- 'Walk Rick gate Johnny between'

- 'The moose fiendishly decalcified the hieroglyphics between the Dagestani Giraffes'

- 'Somebody set up us the bomb. All your base are belong to us.'

---

### Grammaticality judgements are about language, not individual words

- 'Gleeble' - A small fish

- 'To Garflabble' - To perform an elaborate mating display

- 'Flundubble' - A large octopus-like creature

---
'Gleeble' - A small fish

'To Garflabble' - To perform an elaborate mating display

'Flundubble' - A large octopus-like creature

<section class="clicker"></section>

### Is the sentence 'Twelve Flundubble garflabbling gleeble.' grammatical?

A) Yes

B) No

---
'Gleeble' - A small fish

'To Garflabble' - To perform an elaborate mating display

'Flundubble' - A large octopus-like creature

<section class="clicker"></section>

### Is the sentence 'Gleebles garflabble for flundubbles all the time.' grammatical?

A) Yes

B) No

---

### (and by the way, how do we know the plural of 'gleeble'?)

---

![](humorimg/conspiracykeanu.jpg)

* (Nah, it's just phonology)

---

### Is the following sequence grammatical?

---

### How about this one?

---

### Judgements can be more subtle

- ?There looks to be a problem outside
- ?There sounds to be somebody in there
- ?There smells to be something rotten in there
- ?There feels to be something in the bag
- ?There tastes to be an issue with the cookies

---

### We as speakers have strong feelings about the 'correctness' and 'rules' of language

- ... but not so much for other kinds of basic communicative gestures

- So, this is yet another element of Language

---

### Characteristic #3

## Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

---

### There are other characteristics that are important in human Language

- Language is symmetrical (e.g. we can send and recieve)

- Language can talk about situations not in the 'here and now'

- Language is made of discrete, isolateable units (like words or sounds)

- Language has slang, taboo words

- Language accomplishes certain functions (e.g. asking questions, issuing commands)

- All languages can be translated into any other

- But the three we'll focus on are...

---
### Three important characteristics of Language

- 1 - Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified

- 2 - Fully Productive and Creative

- 3 - Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

- **All human languages share these properties!**

---

### Given that human languages seem to share some properties

- ... and we're yet to find a group of humans without language

- Some theorists have argued that this is evidence for...

---

# Universal Grammar

---

### Universal Grammar

- An idea initially posited by Noam Chomsky

---

### A Note on the Noam

![](people/noam_chomsky.jpg)

---

### Universal Grammar

An idea initially posited by Noam Chomsky

- UG holds that there's some genetic basis to human language

- Some properties of human language are innate

	- Not just the ones to do with physical structures

- There are a set of constraints governing language that are 'built in' to our physiology

---

### UG is not facts about your individual language

- A child of two Mandarin Chinese speakers, raised by English speakers, will speak English

- Every language is *not* the same, and linguistic grammar varies substantially

- *UG is about biological predisposition to Language, not to A language*

---

### Evidence for UG

- No cultures, people, or societies have been found with no language

- No other species has been found with human-like language

- Children acquire language impressively well

	- Even in cultures where people don't speak to children
	
- Signed languages show similar properties to spoken languages

	- Even when they arise in isolation
	
- Some things appear to be universal

	- The big one is Recursion
	
---

### Evidence against UG

- There doesn't seem to be good biological evidence for it

- Many properties of human language can be derived from functional facts about communication

- Recursion might not be universal
  
	- Dan Everett (and others) claim that speakers of Pirah√£ lack recursion
	- Pirah√£ is a pretty neat language

- [Even Chomksy doesn't support this view anymore](https://dlc.hypotheses.org/1269)

---

### Are elements of Linguistic structure innate?

- There was a major change between the 9th (2010) and 11th (2018) editions of the textbook

	- Innatist arguments have gone from 'unquestioned' to 'questionable' in the field

- Lots of smart folks have lined up on both sides of this argument

	- ... and there's no sign of a consensus yet!
	
- I just want you to know the idea behind UG
	
---

### But we've now got a pretty good handle on what Language is

---

# What *isn't* Language

---

### Alternative means of coding languages

- [Semaphore](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/semaphore.htm) and Morse Code

	- These are just re-coding an existing language

- Writing systems

	- They're closely associated with an existing spoken or signed human language

---

### Computer Programming Languages

- Languages like COBOL, C++, Java, Python, Rust

---
<img class="r-stretch" src="img/cpluspluscalc.png">
---

### Are programming languages languages?

- 1 - Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified

- 2 - Fully Productive and Creative

- 3 - Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

---

### Are programming languages languages?

<correct>1 - Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified</correct>

2 - Fully Productive and Creative

3 - Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

<correct>1 - Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified</correct><br><br>

<danger>2 - Fully Productive and Creative</danger><br><br>

<correct>3 - Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language</correct>

---

So, no.

* ### (Current) Computer Programming languages are not Language

---

### (Sorry, Hal)

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/hal9000.jpg">

---

## Do any non-humans have language?

---

## Yes, but only one so far

---

### Large Language Models can produce human language

- Large Transformer-based Neural language models (like ChatGPT or OpenAssistant) are now capable of producing robust, grammatical, and used-as-humans-would language

- They have 'passed the bar' for many linguists as competent language users
	- Most of the historical problems language models faced are now 'solved'
	- *This is different than saying 'These are true AI'*

- [They are much less efficient language learners than children](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07998)
	- ... and work is ongoing to see whether they can do more with less

---

### Aside: ChatGPT has no plausible 'universal grammar'

- The code doesn't include grammatical facts, a 'language organ', or innate grammatical patterns

- English models have accidentally learned some other languages
	- (e.g. it appears to be able to use one languages' patterns to generalize)

- [Some UG Folks are still fighting](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/noam-chomsky-chatgpt-ai.html) (also [this](https://mronline.org/2023/04/24/chatgpt-and-human-intelligence-noam-chomsky-responds-to-critics/))

---

## There is finally another kind of thing which can do human language

- ... and it's a very large matrix of numbers.
	- Weird.

---

### What about living creatures?

---

### Lots of animals communicate

- Mating calls

- Alert calls

- Territorial displays

---

### Mimicry

### Nim Chimpsky

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/nimchimpsky.jpg">

---

### Nim Chimpsky

- A chimpanzee raised in a human family to learn ASL by Herbert Terrace

- Learned 125 signs (maybe fewer)

- Combined signs to produce 2-4 word utterances

---

### Nim Chimpsky didn't seem to have full-on language

- Never got past 2-4 sign utterances

	- 'Nim Banana Me Eat'
	
- Only 7% of utterances served to advance the conversation

- 39% of utterances were repetitions of what had just been signed

- Entirely 'pragmatic' use of language

- Terrace argued that Nim never learned anything 

- There were some methodological... oddities

---

### Nim led a pretty sad life

- Became rather strong and violent, as male chimps do.

- Later given back to a research facility and used for medical research

- Still used signs (e.g. 'play', hug') from time to time

- Died at an animal rescue ranch of a heart attack

- Featured in the (sad) documentary [Project Nim](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1814836/)

### Brown-headed Cowbirds

- 'Brood Parasites'

	- Lay their eggs in other birds' nests

- How do they know that they're not the other birds?

- [Innately recognized 'passphrase' calls](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/220/13/2345)

	- 'AHA!  These are my people!'

### The Honeybee 'Waggle Dance'

---

### Bat Vocalizations

- According to [Prat et al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39419), bat vocalizations have detectable information about...

- The speaker

- Behavior context (e.g. feeding, mating, perching, sleep)

- The desired listener

---

### Prairie Dogs

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/prairiedog.jpg">

---

### Prairie Dog Language?

- [Dr. Con Slobodchikoff](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~cns3/) argues that prairie dogs have...

- Different calls for different species of predators

- Calls containing descriptive information about location, size, shape, color of predators

- Prairie dogs will alarm differently on the basis of your shirt

	- Yes, prairie dogs are judging your fit
	
- Some signs of new calls for shapes

- [A great video on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1kXCh496U0)

---

### But is it language?

- We've only seen one domain of 'language'

	- A rich vocabulary of various forms of 'Oh crap! Hide!'

- There's no sign of non-pragmatic language use

	- e.g. "Hey Herbie, remember all those grubs we ate last month?  Yeah, that was great"
	
- So, we'd need more data to call this 'Language'

	- ... and I need to see this work replicated!

---

### So, do non-human animals have Language?

- Nobody's truly doing human language yet

- There's evidence of complex information being encoded

- ... but we're still gonna need more evidence before it's 'Language'

---

### Quick note

- I expect this portion of the lecture to continue to change during my career
	- There are too many interesting studies coming out
	- I didn't expect language to emerge in LLMs, and then it did
	- ... and the move away from UG in the field will broaden some perspectives

- We don't necessarily understand the means by which animals communicate
	- An alien who doesn't see visible light or hear frequencies between 20Hz and 20kHz would think us telepaths
	
- At some level, western society is *very* interested in *not* discovering animal language	

- Doing so would trigger many uncomfortable conversations!

---

### So, we know what language is.

- We know it's a universal thing, although with variation

- And we know that animals don't seem to do it (yet?)

- Now, for the (potentially) scarier side of Language

---

### We think in language, regularly

- We use linguistic concepts in categorizing the world

- We discuss the world using our most available set of terms

- We lack terms for some more abstract feelings

- So, language is a part of our thinking process

- This leads many to ask...

---

## Does the language we speak determine how we think?

---

### The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

- Also known as 'Linguistic Relativity'

- 'The language you speak influences how you think about the world'

- This is fascinating and terrifying

---

### There are many possible forms

- **No effect**: 'The language we speak has *zero* effect on our thought or cognition'

- **Weak**: 'The language we speak has some effect on our thought and cognition'

- **Strong**: 'The language we speak guides our thought and cognition'

- **Determinism**: 'The language we speak *determines* our thought and cognition'

---

### The debate is now mostly about effect size and domain

- It's clear that there's *some* effect

	- [See Dr. Lera Boroditsky at UCSD make a great case](https://www.ted.com/talks/lera_boroditsky_how_language_shapes_the_way_we_think)
	
- But it's also clear that it's not deterministic

	- We can recognize and discuss objects, events, or colors which we don't have words for
	
- The debate is now focused on the size and nature of the effect

	- ... and whether/how much it *actually* matters in our lives
	
---

### This is an amazing area of research

- ... and it's one I wish we could spend more time on

---

## For next time...

- Watch [Dr. Boroditsky's TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/lera_boroditsky_how_language_shapes_the_way_we_think)

	- Not required, but worth your time
