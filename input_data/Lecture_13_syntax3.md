# Syntax 3: Syntax is a Life Sentence

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---
 	 	 	  
### Today's Plan

- A bit more tree practice

- All that we're leaving behind

---

### Syntactic Ambiguity is Everywhere!

---

### Grab some scratch paper

- That's right, we're killing trees to make trees!

---

### OK, let's start off with something easy!

---

### Jessica dislikes that her silly husband cooked a big squishy tofurkey for their romantic dinner

---

- Let's take it piece by piece :)

- Work through each chunk

- Click in with 'B' when you start a chunk, and 'A' when you finish, and 'E' if you're lost

---

### For the record, Tofurkeys are gross

- Great for comedy, poor for eating

Here's another one!

---

### The prescriptivist English Professor glared at the rebellious linguist

---

Spoiler alert.

---

### The prescriptivist English Professor glared at the rebellious linguist

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_engprof.jpg">

---

### OK, OK, enough with the trees!

- Yeah, I know.

---

### This is the problem with LIGN 101

- There's too much awesomeness to Syntax for me to cover in three classes

- We need to focus on what's crucial
 	
 	- (You all understanding syntactic hierarchy)

- ... over what's awesome

 	- Cross-linguistic patterns and advanced syntactic questions

---

### ... and a whole lot has been dismissed as "Here there be dragons"

---

# Introducing some Dragons

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/smaug.jpg">

---

## English Syntax is *way* more complicated

---

### We're looking at relatively simple sentences

- (It may not feel that way, but we are!)

---

### "Truly, my dismay that three dragons were slain by the fame-craving knight couldn't be greater."

- Your phrase structure rules will shatter against such pain.

---

### "Robert who came last weekend when you threw that party where Marvin saw Bob is kind of a jerk."

- That's right, that's two S's inside an NP

---

### Also, sentences will do weird things

- Weird things will be done by sentences.

- Weird things will be the things that sentences do.

- What will sentences do?

- Will sentences do weird things?

---

### Passive Voice

- Miguel threw Rajesh the ball.

- Rajesh was thrown the ball.

- **Passive voice turns the object of a sentence into the subject**

---

### This is a 200 foot pole

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/long_pole.jpg">

- The passive voice will not be touched with it

---

### This makes us think about 'movement' and 'transformation'

- Phrase structure rules don't account for changes

---

### Jessica can buy Cheerios

- Can Jessica buy Cheerios?

- It was Jessica who bought the Cheerios

- Cheerios are what Jessica bought

- Who can buy Cheerios?

- What can Jessica buy?

- Jessica can buy what?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/jessica_buy_what.jpg">

(Thanks Jaron from W22!)

---

### The movement... it's everywhere

- Your book gets a bit deeper into this than we have time to

- ... but it's cooooooool.

---

## Here's a fun dragon

---

### Garden Path Sentences

Sentences which are easy to incorrectly parse at first

---

### Example Garden Paths

- The old man the boat.

- The complex houses married soldiers and their families.

- The girl told the story cried.

- The man who whistles tunes pianos.

- The war on plastic faces setback as cost of recycled material soars

	- This is from [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/13/war-on-plastic-waste-faces-setback-as-cost-of-recycled-material-soars), and was fixed with 'plastic waste' after publication

---

### The horse raced past the barn fell

---

### These occur in human language

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/gardenpath_dog.jpg">

---

## Let's look at some other sentences

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### A is 'Perfectly Grammatical', E is 'Completely Ungrammatical'

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

## More three dogs bit than eight humans.

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

## More cats are on my bed than I can cuddle them.

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

## More sales are expected this year relative to last year.

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

## More tourists have been to England than to Kazakhstan.

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

## More people have been to Russia than I have.

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

## More politicians self-finance their campaigns in the USA than elsewhere.

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

## More undergrads text their friends during the week than I text my friends.

---

### Wait a second...

- More people have been to Russia than I have.

- More undergrads text their friends during the week than I text my friends.

- **What do these actually mean?!?**

---

### These are called 'Comparative Illusions'

- ... and they show that we can have instincts which make something 'seem' grammatical and sensical which actually isn't!

- The factors which make these feel more or less acceptable are a subject of syntactic research

- They can even happen in natural speech

	- 'I think there are more candidates on stage who speak Spanish more fluently than our president speaks English.' - [Dan Rather](https://twitter.com/danrather/status/1144076809182408704?lang=en)

---

### How about some center embedding gore?

---

> An apparently new speech disorder a linguistics department our correspondent visited was affected by has appeared.

- An apparently new speech disorder
- a linguistics department
- our correspondent 
- visited
- was affected by
- has appeared.

---

> The cause experts the LSA sent investigate remains elusive.

- The cause 
- experts 
- the LSA 
- sent 
- investigate
- remains elusive.

---

> Physicians neurologists psychologists other linguists called for help called for help called for help didn’t help either. 

- Physicians 
- neurologists 
- psychologists 
- other linguists 
- called for help 
- called for help 
- called for help 
- didn’t help either. 

---

> The patient the nurse the doctor consulted was sick.

- The patient 
- the nurse 
- the doctor 
- consulted 
- was sick.
- <danger>wtf?!?!</danger>

---

### Thanks to Emily for some of these syntactic troubles

- Also here's the center embedding [source](https://specgram.com/CLI.2/03.bakery.disorder.html)

---

### Modifier Scope issues

- “Crispy Ahi Tuna Tacos”

	- Crispy tuna, or Crispy Tacos


---

## There are other approaches to Syntax too!

---

### V', S', IP, and more!

- There are many theories and approaches, each with pros and cons

- This is the case in anything in Linguistics, but especially here!

---

## Other Languages exist!

---

### Different languages do sentences differently

- Not all languages put the Subject (do-er) before the verb, which is followed by the object (which is being affected) ('SVO')

- Lakota is SOV, with postpositions

- ASL is OSV

- Spanish adjectives are after the noun

- Russian can move the arguments around to help make your point

---

### Phrase structure rules are language specific, too!

- We'll play with other languages' phrase structure rules in this class!

---

### We're just trying to get you understanding the basics

- What syntax is

- How sentences are composed hierarchically

- ... and how grammar works for sentences

---

### For everything else, LIGN 121

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/plug.jpg">

---

## One last oddity

---
  
### Our rules can act weirdly

Rule 8: VP -> V

Rule 9: VP -> V NP

---

### To sleep

* VP -> V: Will slept

* VP -> V NP: Will slept Jessica

---

### To dream

* VP -> V: Will dreamed

* VP -> V NP: Will dreamed Jessica

---

### To walk

* VP -> V: Will walked

* VP -> V NP: Will walked Jessica

---

### These are called 'Intransitive verbs'

Verbs that only take a single argument, the 'subject'
  
---

### To hug

* VP -> V NP: Will hugged Jessica

* VP -> V: Will hugged

---

### To move

* VP -> V: Will moved

* VP -> V NP: Will moved Jessica

---

### To see

* VP -> V: Will saw

* VP -> V NP: Will saw Jessica

---

### These are called 'Transitive verbs'

Verbs that can take two arguments, a subject and an object

---

### To bake

* VP -> V: Will baked

* VP -> V NP: Will baked a cake

* VP -> V NP NP: Will baked Jessica a cake

* VP -> V NP NP: ?Will baked a cake Jessica

---

### To find

* VP -> V: Will found.

* VP -> V NP: Will found a cake

* VP -> V NP NP: Will found Jessica a cake

* VP -> V NP NP: ?Will found a cake Jessica

* VP -> V NP NP: Will found a cake some candles

---

### Ditransitive Constructions

Verbs that take a Subject and two objects

---

### To see

* VP -> V: ?Will saw

* VP -> V NP: Will saw a cake

* VP -> V NP NP: ?Will saw Jessica a cake

* VP -> V NP NP: &#42;Will saw a cake Jessica

---

## Whoa!!

- That was a phrase structure rule with three branches!

- That happens sometimes, although there are usually other ways!

---

### To make

* VP -> V: Will made

* VP -> V NP: Will made a judge

* VP -> V NP NP: Will made Jessica a judge

* VP -> V NP NP: Will made a judge Jessica

---

### To make, continued

* VP -> V NP: Will made a judge (with his modelling clay)

* VP -> V NP NP: Will made Jessica a robot

* VP -> V NP NP: Will made a robot, Jessica

---

### Are you vibing me?

- "I'm vibing."

- "I'm vibing you."

- "I'm vibing with this new album"

- "I'm vibing this new album"

- "I'm vibing her a new album"

---

### Wait a second...

- Our phrase structure rules don't universally apply

	- A valid phrase structure rule for one verb might not work for another
	
- ... and it seems to be *lexically specific*

	- It depends on the particular word
	
- ## Is there no hope?!

### (Nah, it's cool, we've got semantics)

- See you next time!
