---

## IA Introductions

---

## We are Linguists!

- Gigantic professional language nerds

---

### We're going to learn how we linguists talk about Language

- We'll talk about what Language is

- We'll talk about different aspects of languages

- We'll talk about the subfields which tackle different problems in Language

- We'll talk about the various tools and techniques that Linguists use

- We'll look at actual language data to get a sense of just how complicated all this is

- We'll have lots of fun* in the process

---

### That's what this course is about

---

## How will we teach this class?

---

### We'll teach you here, in section, and in office hours

- Here, we'll talk about concepts and address questions

- In section, you'll dive deep with language data

	- Please attend your designated section
	
	- If you'd like to try and attend a different section, email that section's IA
	
- Office hours are your home to clarify concepts

	- We have a massive number of combined office hours, use them!
	
---

### You'll check your learning using homework, exams, and clickers

- Six homeworks

- A Final Exam (held in this room, ideally!)

- WebClicker questions

---

## Let's look at the syllabus

---

### Coming to lecture isn't magic

- You'll probably want to take notes

	- Don't write down the words I say, write down the ideas

	- Summarize in your own words

	- Slides are available on the syllabus

- Write down questions you have during the lecture

- We as a species are awful at multitasking
	- That's right.  Close Discord.
	- Or just be prepared to re-study later

---

### We're back in meatspace!

- **Masks are strongly recommended, but not required.**

- Here's hoping it stays that way

	- We have a plan in place, in case it doesn't

- Come to class healthy and prepared

- **You have no excuse to come to class sick!**

	- The attendance policy is lax, and you can always just podcast.

---

### Pro-Tip: Sincere effort is incredibly important to me

- 'Blow off' the class, or try to lawyer or cajole your way into an A, and you'll find much no sympathy nor help

	- Low effort, low integrity, or 'cut-corners' work insults the people who you need help from
	
- Put in the effort for us, and we’ll put in effort for you

	- We will bend over backwards to help students who are making a sincere effort

- **If you're struggling, talk to us ASAP**

---

## Any questions?

---

# So, what is Linguistics?

* (Most people have *zero* clue)

---

### "Oh, you're a linguist?  Cool!"

## "How many languages do you speak?"   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

Many linguists speak more than one language, but...

### There's way more to Linguistics than knowing languages <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Linguists study Language

* We're interested in how 'Language' works for humans

	- ... and we study it by looking at Spanish, or Laotian, or Russian, or Kumeyaay

* Learning languages can be a part of that, but it's not the whole!

---

### We're interested in Capital L 'Language'

- ... even as we're studying individual languages

---

... but we have a problem ...

---

## Language is amazingly complex

---

### "The duck quacked gleefully at his bae."

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/bird_mallard.jpg">

---

### "The duck quacked gleefully at his bae."

- How did I make that sequence of sounds and how did you recognize it?

- Why is there a [t] at the end of quack rather than a [d]?

- What does that last sound mean anyways?

- Who quacked at whom?  When?  How do we know?

- What was gleeful?

- Is the duck single? Happy?

- What's a 'bae' anyways? Can a duck have a bae?

---

### (Yes, my slang and memes are dated)

- You'll get the chance to help me in future homework assignments

- <img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/fellowkids.gif">

---

### Language is complex

* ## Linguistics has to be complex too

---

### We'll look at all the complexities

- We'll look at many of the central subfields of Linguistics

- We'll examine other questions that we linguists are also interested in.

---

### What elements of Linguistics will we cover this quarter?

- "How does talking work?" - Phonetics

- "How do sounds change when we combine them?" - Phonology

- "How do we build words?" - Morphology

- "How do we combine words into sentences?" - Syntax

- "What does it all mean?" - Semantics and Pragmatics

---

### What *won't* we cover this quarter

- "How do I have better grammar and be more articulate?"

- "How does Poetry work? Why do some sentences sound more beautiful?"

- "How do I learn languages more quickly and effectively?"

- "How can I become an English-to-Japanese translator?"

- "How does French, or Spanish, or Russian, or Wichita work?"

---

So, that's what we're doing here

---

# Why on Earth does anybody care about Linguistics?

---

### There are a million answers to that question

- Every linguist has their own

	- ... and you'll have your own
	
	- ... when you become a linguist
	
---

![](humorimg/inevitable.jpg)

---

### I'll give you two answers

- Because Linguists do interesting things

- Because Language is AWESOME

---

# Linguists do interesting things!

---

## Theoretical Linguistics

---

### Theoretical Linguistics

- How can we describe *how people communicate*?

- How can we describe *the things people don't do*?

- What are the best models to help us understand language?

- What are the best models which mirror our own cognition?

- How does language change over time?

---

### Linguistic Typology

- How do languages *generally* accomplish communicative goals?  

- Are there patterns across the world?

- What kinds of things are languages more and less likely to do?

- Are there *universal* tendencies in language?

### Let's Talk about Linguistics: It's All About the Wordplay

-   Welcome to our introductory linguistics class! Prepare to have a pun-derful time!
-   We'll be exploring the structure and function of language, so let's get our syntax in order!
-   Don't be a morpheme-phobe, embrace the building blocks of language!
-   Get ready to dig deep into phonology, and learn how to make sounds that are truly phe-nominal!
-   We'll be tackling some complex linguistic concepts, but don't worry, we'll make it easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy!
- Remember, in linguistics, the possibilities are endless, and the puns are always on the table!

## Languages differ in how they put sounds together

<lang>English</lang><br><ldata>I-E, Germanic, West Germanic - All over the place</ldata>

'Strengths'  (/stɹɛŋkθs/)

## Not all languages use the same modality!

---

### Spoken languages use speech to express meanings

- We're familiar with this!

- ... but even 'spoken' language involves gesture and visual cues!

---

### Written language is used to express meanings

- Like this!

- Not all languages have writing systems

- Some different languages use the same writing system

- Some people can only understand each other in writing

---

### Signed languages use gesture, facial expression, and movement  to express meanings

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/asl_pourdrink.gif">

---

### Other languages are felt!

- Braille is a touch-based writing system for English

- [ProTactile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfICNTq6ITY) is an emerging language designed to be used by folks who are both Deaf and Blind.

- Other forms of communication which rely on touch exist!

## Languages differ in how they work with words

## Linguists study *all* language, not just 'proper' language

---

### New language has studyable meaning too!

- rizz
	- "Will may not have enough rizz to get away with using Gen-Z slang."

- sus 
	- "I'm pretty sus about some of his theories."

- uwu
	- "I am going to UwU this presentation!"

- bussin
	- "As gas prices rise, more students are bussin to campus"
	
- simp
	- "That test was simp, I was done in ten minutes"
	
---

### I know what you're thinking...

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/cringe.gif">

---

### This shows we have intuitions about all language use!

- We can talk about any words, even new words, being grammatical or not

- We know when *any* language that we use is being used properly

- Words have legitimate and 'correct' meanings, even if they're not in the dictionary

- The -ussy suffix (e.g. bussy, pizzussy) was the American Dialect Society's 2022 'Word of the Ear'

- All language is language!

---

### Let's try that again

- rizz
	- "She seduced her with AI Generated romantic texts.  ChatGPT got W rizz."

- sus
	- "Will's knowledge of Gen-Z slang is still pretty sus."

- uwu
	- uwu is not an adjective but an attitude.  winguwistics!

- bussin
	- "These newer slang examples are bussin"
	
- simp
	- "Don't be a simp, Chomsky will never cite you even if you mention him 500 times."
	
---

### So, there you go

That's why we care.

## My goal for this course
