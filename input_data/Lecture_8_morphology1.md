$ LIGN 101 - Morphology

### Please visit office hours if you have questions!

- IA office hours are often empty and sad!

- If you don't 'get' phonology or IPA yet, go, let them help you

	- They have more datasets and they want to help!

- Also check out the Video on the Bantu dataset

- It's a good idea to review the lecture notes before sections

---

### Please be conscientious with exception and extension requests

- If you just started the assignment shortly before asking for the extension, it's not happening

	- We drop an assignment for everybody, precisely to help you make a mistake without hurting too badly

	- I have a [whole site talking about how to make good and bad requests](https://savethevowels.org/gradechanges).

- If you put in the work for us, we'll bend over backwards for you, but we have to be fair to everybody!

# Morphology: How words are built

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---
 	 	 	  
### Today's Plan

- What is morphology?

- Types of morphemes

- Types of words

- Building new words

---

# What is Morphology?

---

## Morphology

- The study of the shape and formation of words


---

### Words are often not monolithic

- They're often made of smaller components

- These components are called '**morphemes**'

	- The smallest piece of a word which expresses a meaning or function

---

## How do we know that English has a past tense marker like -ed?

---

### Form-Meaning Correspondences

- We can detect these components by looking for correspondences between form and meaning

- "If the same meaning keeps showing up with the same form in a word, that chunk of form must carry meaning!"

---

### Forming English Plurals

- /kæt/ vs /kæts/

- /sit/ vs. /sits/

- /pat/ vs. /pats/

- "Huh, it sure looks like words with -s at the end are plural. '-s' must be a meaningful chunk!"

- These recurring chunks that seem to have meaning are **morphemes**

---

### Many words are composed of many morphemes

- *... and each morpheme's meaning contributes to the word's meaning!*

- played (play-ed)
 	- play + past tense
 	
- blacken (black-en)
 	- black + ‘cause to become’
 	
- unroll (un-roll)
 	- reverse of ‘roll’
 	
- depressurization (de-pressure-ize-ation)
 	- undo + pressure + verbalizer + nominalizer

---

### There are two kinds of morpheme

- Bound, and Free Morphemes

---

### Free Morphemes

- Can stand on their own, do not have to attach to some other form
  
- Cat, Show, Class, Panda, Walk, Purple

---

### Bound Morphemes

- Can’t stand on their own, must be attached to some other morpheme

 	- -ed,  -s,  -ing,  -er,  un-, -aholic, cran-

---

### Bound Morphemes (or 'Affixes')

- **Prefixes** - Go before the root

 	- Re-do, Un-screw, Over-come

- **Suffixes** - Go after the root

 	- walk-ed, cat-s, end-ing

- **Infixes** - Go inside the root

 	- Khmer: leun ‘fast’ -> l-b-eun ‘speed’
 	
- **Circumfixes** - Go to either side of the root

 	- German: spielen 'to play' -> ge-spiel-t 'played'

### So, those are morphemes

- There are many, *many* kinds of morphemes

- Accomplishing many tasks

- ... and they're the building blocks of *words*

---

# Words

---

### Words are made up of morphemes

- Sometimes just one, sometimes many

 	- We'll spend some time there later today

- ... but once constructed, words have many different types

---

### Lexical Categories

- Also known as "Parts of Speech"

- The *types* of words which occur in language

---

### Lexical Categories

- **Nouns**: bike, car, cat, dog, tofu, dude, bling

- **Verbs:** go, eat, talk, walk

- **Adjectives:** lit, sweet, hot, cool, awesome

- **Adverbs:** well, fast, slowly, easily

- **Pre/postpositions:** with, from, on, in

---

### Lexical Categories (continued)

- **Determiners:** the, a, that, this, those

- **Pronouns:** she, he, him, her, it, I, you, they

- **Conjunctions:** and, or, whenever, while

- **Numeral:** one, twice, third

- **Interjection:** ouch, tsk, damnit!

---

### How do we identify the different parts of speech?

- These generalizations will work for English, but similar ones are available

---

### Nouns

- Describe a person, place or thing

- Can be singular or plural

 	- book/books or car/cars, but not quickly/ &#42;quicklys and beg/ &#42;begs
 	- red/reds?

- Can be paired with a determiner (e.g. "I like the/a...")

 	- I like the book/car/cat/show
 	
 	- \*I like the angry/rotate/beg/quickly

---

### Verbs

- Can take tense marking in English

 	- He rotates, she rotated
 	- He learns, she learned
 	- &#42;He angrys, &#42;He angryed

- Can work with modals

 	- I will teach, but &#42;I will angry.
 	- I can run, but &#42;I can laptop.

---

### Adjectives

- Comparative Constructions

 	- Happy/Happier, but &#42;teacher/teacher
 	- Angry/Angrier, but &#42;cat/cater

- Superlative Constructions

 	- Mad/Maddest, but &#42;commute/commutest
 	- Purple/Purplest, but &#42;penguin/penguinest

- Very/too Constructions

 	- Very bad, very angry, very purple, very ugly
 	- &#42;Very teach, &#42;Very cat, &#42;Very linguist

---

### There are always some exceptions

- Words can be used as other categories

 	- "Wow, that's so fly"

 	- "You look very... linguist today"

 	- "I can't adult right now"

- Words that don't fit the pattern

 	- &#42;She looks much eleganter
 	- &#42;I cutted the bush
 	- &#42;Three sheeps ran across the path
 	
---

### Adverbs are hard

- "the most nebulous and puzzling of the traditional word classes”

 	- (Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, & Svartvik, 1985)

- They can modify anything non-nominal

- ![](morphology/adverb_modification.jpg)

---

### There are many flavors of adverbs

- **Temporal**: Now, then, yesterday, always, tomorrow, next week

- **Locative**: Here, there, abroad

- **Sentence**: Perhaps, fortunately, honestly, frankly

- **Manner**: Quickly, carefully, excitedly, beautifully

- **Linking**: Therefore, thus, consequently

- **Degree**: Very, too, extremely

---

### Prepositions

- Indicate a semantic relationship between other entities

 	- "Any relationship a squirrel can have with a tree"

 	- Under, around, on top of, behind, near, adjacent to, below, above, in, on...

- These don't change form in English

---

### Postpositions

- Many languages instead use **postpositions**, which go after the thing(s) they modify but function like prepositions.

- English doesn't have postpositions, but Turkish does!

Çocuk-lar **bahçe-de** oyn-uyor.  
Kid-PL garden-in play-ing (PROG).  
'Kids are playing in the garden.''

- About [half of the languages in WALS](https://wals.info/feature/85A#2/16.3/152.9) use postpositions

- Inpositions and circumpositions are a thing too

---

### Pronouns

- Substitute for noun phrases

 	- "I saw the gal who Kati noticed was carrying a hamster in her backpack"
 	
 	- "I saw **her**"
 	
---

### There are many kinds of pronouns

- Personal Pronouns

 	- 1st Person (I, me, mine), 2nd person (You, Yours), 3rd (she/her/hers, he/him/his, them/them/theirs, and others)
 	
- Indefinite Pronouns

 	- Someone, everybody, nobody, any, anything, something
 	
- Interrogative Pronouns

 	- "You saw who/what where/when?"
 	
- Relative pronouns

 	- "I saw the girl **who** knew the cat **that** ate the bird **which** I was watching."
 	
- Demonstrative pronouns

 	- This, these, that, those
 	
---

### Determiners

- Determiners mark and precede nouns

- **The/an** interesting book
- **Those** cookies
- **Which** movie did you see?

- Determiners don't vary in form

---

### Types of Determiners

- **Possessive**: My, your, her, our, his, its, their

- **Demonstrative**: This, these, that, those

- **Interrogative**: which, what, whose

- **Definite**: the

- **Indefinite**: a/an

---

### My favorite determiner joke

---

> 'The' and 'a' walk into a bar. 'A' says, "Hey, what's up bro, I haven't seen you in ages.  Are you still marking noun phrases?" 'The' replies "Definitely!"

---

### Conjunctions

- Used to link expressions

- Sunny **and** warm

- Red **or** blue?

- He rolled over **while** I was petting him.

---

### Let's practice a bit

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### "The [tiny] dog quickly scurried between the buildings"

A) Noun

B) Verb

C) Adjective

D) Preposition

E) Adverb

---

### All languages have grammatical categories

- Although the lines between them can be blurrier or cleaner

- ... and some languages don't necessarily use all of them

---

### We can group these categories into larger sets

- Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs are **content words**

 	- A very large set of words, which express new meanings

- Pre/Postpositions, Determiners, Pronouns, Conjunctions are **function words**

 	- A small, finite set of words which help combine other words

---

### Content and Function words change differently in languages

- We very rarely gain new **Function words** (Pre/Postpositions, Determiners, Pronouns, Conjunctions)

- We often gain new **Content words** (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs)

- Function words are a **closed class**, and content words are an **open class**

---

### New function words are pretty rare

- "I didn't see the last Transformers movie **because** Michael Bay" (new preposition)

- "I spent last night in the library doing homework **slash** looking at pictures of cats" (new conjunction)

---

### New content words are really common

- Bae (Noun)

- Twerk (Verb)

- Rekt (Adjective)

- No cap (Adverb)

- Yeet (Verb)

---

### Wait, how do you create a new word, anyways?

---

### What other words or morphemes are new lately?

---

### Wrapping up 

- Morphology is the study of how words are built

- Words are made of Morphemes

- Morphemes have different types

- Words have different types

- Words are made in many ways

---

### Next time
