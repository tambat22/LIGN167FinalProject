# Semantics: What does it all mean?

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---

### So far, we've been focused on structure

- How are sounds made?

- How do sounds pattern?

- How are words made?

- How do words pattern?

---

### It's time to start thinking about what it all means

- Quite literally.

---

## Semantics

The study of meaning in Language

---

## Pragmatics

The study of meaning in conversational context

---

### We're going to spend some time with both of these

- Today, we'll focus on meaning in a greater sense

- Next time, word meanings

- After that, we'll talk about Pragmatics

---
			  
### Today's Plan
	
- Truth in Sentences

- Ambiguity

- Entailment

- Connotation and Denotation

- Prototypes

---

# Truth in sentences

---

### Sentences can be true, or false, with reference to the world

- Since words have meanings, and those meanings can be defined logically...

- We can evaluate the logical truth of a sentence.

---

### Sometimes, it's easy

---

### Tautology

- All linguists are linguists.

- Every bachelor is unmarried.

- A circle is circular.

- The long cat is long.

- *All tautologies are true!*

---

### Contradictions

- A circle is triangular.

- French people are not French.

- Will is tall and short.

- *All contradictions are false!*

---

### Meaningless sentences

- "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously"

- *Meaningless sentences lack meaning!*

---

### Non-Statement Sentences

- **Commands:** Turn in your homework!

- **Questions:** Have you turned in your homework?

- **Greetings:** Welcome to UC San Diego!

- *These can't be evaluated as they're not making claims*

---

### Speech Acts / Performative Language

- I sentence you to three weeks of probation.

- I now pronounce you married.

- *More on these in Pragmatics!*

---

## Declarative sentences can thus be shown to be true or false.

---

### "Will waved"

- There is a set of people who waved.

- If Will is in that set, this sentence is true.

- If Will is not, this sentence is false.

---

### Compositional Semantics

- Syntactic structure, coupled with understanding of meaning of individual phrases, allows the determination of meaning via rules.

- This is *really* cool stuff.

---

### For compositional semantics, LIGN 130 and LIGN 230

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/plug.jpg">

---

### Sometimes, it's hard to figure out what the meaning is

---

# Ambiguity

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/ambiguity.jpg">

---

### Three kinds of Ambiguity

- Syntactic/Structural Ambiguity

- Lexical Ambiguity

- Semantic Ambiguity

---

## Structural/Syntactic Ambiguity

- "I'm not sure what syntactic structure you're going for there"

---

### "I saw the man with the telescope"

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_manwithtelescope1.jpg">

---

### "I saw the man with the telescope"

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_manwithtelescope2.jpg">

---

### "I saw the Queen of England's Hat"
- Note, this requires two new rules, N' -> N' PP and DET -> NP POSS

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_queenenglandshat1.jpg">

---

### "I saw the Queen of England's Hat"

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_queenenglandshat2.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/binladen_mask.jpg">

---


## Lexical Ambiguity

- "I'm not sure what sense of the word you're using"

---

### Word Sense

- The same sequence of phonemes can have multiple meanings

	- This is known as 'polysemy'

- The "sense" is the particular meaning in use at a moment.

- "Spam", "Lit", "Broke", "Turn", "Lemon"

---

### Lexically Ambiguous Sentences

- "He sold her a lemon"

	- A bad car, or a citrus fruit.

- "Stop sending me spam"

	- Spiced ham, or commercial email

- "Will cut up the center of the paper"

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/go_long.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/beeftonight.jpg">
  
---

## Semantic Ambiguity

"I know the structure, and I know the senses, but there are multiple readings"

---

### "John kissed his wife, and so did Alex"

- Two people kissing two wives, or one wife kissing two people?

- "John kissed Amy, and so did Alex" is not ambiguous

- "John kissed his wife, and Alex kissed his own wife"

---

### "Bob and Joe are married."

- "Bob and Joe are married to each other"

- "Bob and Joe are married, but Sean, Mike, and Adam are single"

---

### "Every student hates a professor."

- "Every student hates at least one professor that they've had, whoever that may be."

- "Every student hates one professor, and his name is Will Styler"

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/ambiguity_throwthemout.jpg">

---

### There are other types of ambiguity, but these are the three you'll want to know

- Lexical Ambiguity

	- "I can't figure out **what word sense** is being used."

- Syntactic Ambiguity

	- "I can't figure out **which syntactic structure** is intended."

- Semantic Ambiguity

	- "I can't figure out **which of several interpretations** you intend without more context."

---

### So, that's when meaning isn't clear.

- Let's talk about the opposite!

---

# Entailment

---

## Entailment

When the use of a word involves logical and necessary conclusions which can be drawn

- "If X is true, then necessarily, Y is true"

- You cannot imagine a situation in which X being true does not make Y true

---

### Sam broke the red toy and the blue toy.

**Entails...**

- The red toy is broken

- The blue toy is broken

- Sam broke two toys.

- Sam is capable of breaking toys.

---

### Sam broke the red toy and the blue toy.

**Does not entail...**

- Sam intentionally broke the toys

- Sam broke the red toy first.

- Sam likes breaking toys.

- They were Sam's toys

---

### Mary passionately kissed Blake

**Entails...**

- Mary kissed Blake

- Blake was kissed by Mary.

- Blake was kissed.

- Mary touched Blake with her lips.

---

### Mary passionately kissed Blake

**Does not entail...**

- Mary loves Blake.

- Mary married Blake.

- Blake kissed Mary.

- Mary kissed Blake many times.

- Mary did *not* kiss Blake.

---

### X entails Y does not mean that Y entails X!

- "Mary passionately kissed Blake" entails "Mary kissed Blake"

- "Mary kissed Blake" **does not** entail "Mary passionately kissed Blake".

	- Mary could have offered a reluctant and chaste peck on the cheek

---

### Entailment *does not* depend on conversational context or situations

- "John left the room" **does not** entail that the room is empty afterwards.

	- "Mary and John were in the room. John left the room"

	- "John was alone in the room. John left the room."

- Entailment is true **only** if you cannot imagine a situation where it could be false.

	- "Mary kissed Blake" can never not entail that Blake was kissed by Mary.
	
- If it depends on context, it's *implicature*.

A) Carlos was hit with a rubber chicken.

B) Roberta had a Rubber Chicken

C) Roberta dislikes Carlos

D) Roberta was within rubber-chicken-hitting distance of Carlos

E) Roberta hit Carlos

---

C) <correct>Roberta dislikes Carlos</correct>

D) Roberta was within rubber-chicken-hitting distance of Carlos

E) Roberta hit Carlos

A) Demetrius was within line-of-sight of the kid

B) Demetrius saw a child.

C) Demetrius was on the street.

D) The kid was walking.

E) Demetrius was older than the kid.

---

### "Demetrius saw the kid who was walking down the street".  Which of the following *is* entailed by this sentence?

A) Demetrius was within line-of-sight of the kid

B) Demetrius saw a child.

C) Demetrius was on the street.

D) <correct>The kid was walking.</correct>

E) Demetrius was older than the kid.

---

### Making assumptions when evaluating entailment is baaaaaaaaad

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/kidgoat.jpg">

---

### Understanding entailment requires you to understand the meaning of words

- "Nathan is a District Attorney" entails that "Nathan is an Attorney"

- "Nathan is a District Attorney" entails that "Nathan is a Lawyer"

- "Nathan is an attorney" **does not** entail that "Nathan is a district attorney"

- "Nathan is an attorney" **does not** entail that "Nathan is a lawyer"

- All of these terms are system specific

	- In a different legal system, the terms might be defined differently

---

### ... and meaning is complicated af

---

# Connotation and Denotation: Shades of Meaning

---

### There are many ways to say the same thing

- Words that 'mean the same thing' are called 'synonyms'

---

### Synonyms

- "Sofa" and "Couch"

- "Pop" and "Soda"

- "Sick" and "Ill"

- "Police Officer" and "Cop"

---

### Synonyms can be tested

- "All sofas are couches, and all couches are sofas"

- "John purchased a car, therefore he bought a car"

- "All sick people are ill, and all ill people are sick"

- "All police officers are cops, and all cops are police officers"

---

### Let's look at another set of words that 'mean the same thing'

- "Cheap" and "Inexpensive"

- "Strong-willed", "Stubborn", and "Pig-Headed"

- "Study" and "Scrutinize"

- "curious" and "nosy"

- "vintage" and "outdated" and "antique"

---

### These words share a *denotation*, but have different *connotations*

- "Cheap" and "inexpensive" both mean "costs little money"

	- ... but it means something different to say "a cheap broom" vs. "an inexpensive broom"

- A person can be "strong-willed", "stubborn" or "pig-headed"

	- ... depending on how angry you are with them at the moment

- "She studied the paper" does not mean the same thing as "She scrutinized the paper"

- Nobody sells outdated clothing, they sell vintage clothing

---

### These differentiate the 'denotation' of a word, from the 'connotation'

- The 'Denotation' is the strict dictionary definition of a word

	- Cheap and Inexpensive both mean "Something that costs little money"
	
- The 'Connotation' describes the non-definitional, emotional and associative facts about how the word is often used.

	- These are often value judgements, or links to related concepts

	- These are facts about usage, more than facts about definition

	- 'Cheap' implies "Not great", inexpensive doesn't.

---

### Strong-Willed, Pig-headed, Stubborn

- **Denotation**: Shows determination not to change one's path or attitude, despite arguments otherwise

- Strong-Willed Connotation?

- Pig-Headed Connotation?

- Stubborn Connotation?

---

### Let's try some sets

- New, Novel, Contemporary, Up-To-Date, State-of-the-Art, Recent

- Aggressive, Assertive, Domineering, Dynamic, Forceful, Pushy

- Offended, insulted, outraged, butthurt, upset

---

### Some words have connotations that associate them with specific contexts

- "inner city" has a specific racial connotation in general use

	- "I live in Central Park West in NYC, inner city life isn't for everybody"

- "Lib" has a specific political connotation in general use

	- "Bernie Sanders is a well known lib politician"

---

### Sometimes, we take steps to avoid a negative connotation

---

## Euphemism

An indirect and "pretty" way to refer to something unpleasant or embarrassing or with a negative connotation

---

### Sample Euphemisms

- "We neutralized three combatants" rather than "We killed three enemy fighters"

- "We expect another round of downsizing" rather than "You all are gonna get fired".

- "Could you point me to the powder room?" rather than "I have to defecate immediately."

- "The children were placed in a [tender-age shelter](https://apnews.com/dc0c9a5134d14862ba7c7ad9a811160e)" rather than "We stuck the children in a detention camp".

	- This was the [ADS Word of the Year](https://www.americandialect.org/tender-age-shelter-is-2018-american-dialect-society-word-of-the-year) for 2018

---

### Connotations aren't universally shared!

- The same word may have different connotations among different groups

	- What's offensive to one group of people might be the neutral term to another
	
	- 'We prefer the term...'

- People may not be aware of the connotations of words they're using

	- 'We've decided not to have kids' vs. 'We're childfree'
	
- ... and most importantly...

---

### Connotations can change over time

- Imbecile, Idiot, Slow, Retarded, Mentally Handicapped, Developmentally Disabled

- This phenomenon (euphemisms turning into negative terms then being replaced) is called the "Euphemism Treadmill"

---

### Torture your local millenials and Gen-Xers

- "Oh, I always wondered what the internet was like in the late 1900s"

- "The world of cell phones was very different at the turn of the century"

- "Instructors used overhead projectors as late as last century"

---

### Connotations can do a *lot* of work

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/butt_dial_booty_call.jpg">

---

### The lines here are blurry

- "Butt dial" and "Booty call" may be two different compounds.

	- Booty text? Butt Text?
	
	- Or are they Adjective+Noun pairs?
	
- Does "thin" mean the same thing as "gaunt"?

- When does "idiot" stop meaning "intellectually disabled person" and start meaning "stupid person"?

- **It's hard to figure out which of many word options carries the best choice of meaning**

---

### This can lead to Semantic Change

- Where words start with one meaning and develop a new one

- This can cause a new word sense, or just an overall change in meaning

- Think 'influencer' or ' mid'

---

... But even single words are a bit hard to define

---

# Semantic Prototype Theory

---

### We have ideas about what words mean

- "Bird"

- "Chair"

---

### We also have strong intuitions about whether a word describes an object or not.

- ... but these intuitions are not binary ("yes" vs. "no")

---

### Let's test this!

---

### What is a bird?

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/chair_dining.jpg">

---

### A 'Prototype'

An example of a given word or meaning which is "central" to the category, a "better example" of the idea.

---

### This captures a number of intuitions

- The Pope is pretty far from the prototype for "Bachelor"

- An emu is pretty far from the prototype for "Bird"

- A stack of pizza boxes is pretty far from the prototype for "Chair"

---

### So, even within a word, meaning can be a bit gradient

- ... and a single word can refer variably to many things

---

### Wrapping Up

- Meaning is complicated

- We can determine meaning using fancy semantic footwork

- We can tell when meaning is unclear or ambiguous

- We can tell when one sentence entails another

- There's more to a word than the dictionary definition

- ... and even definitions can feel pretty gradient

---

## Next time

- We'll focus on individual word meanings

- And we'll start talking about meaning in context

- Bring meaning
