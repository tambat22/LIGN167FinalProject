# Phonology: The Sound Patterns of Language

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---

### Today's Plan

- What is phonology?

- Phonemic Analysis from three different perspectives

- How to tell if your instructor is actually Batman

- Writing phonological rules

---

### First, a note on notation

- We're going to start differentiating words in IPA between // and [ ]

- /tap/ means 'top' at an abstract level.

- [tap] means that sequence of sounds at a surface level.

- /tap/ exists in the speaker's mind, [tap] exits a person's mouth

- More later...

---

### So, now we know roughly what speech is like

- What sounds we're using in English

- How to describe them

- ... and some symbols we can use to talk about sounds, not letters

---

### ... so, we should just be able to put the sounds together and we‚Äôre good, right?

---

### /…™/ /k/ /p/ /s/ /d/

- [sk…™p]
- [k…™d]
- [p…™k]
- [s…™p]
- [d…™p]
- [k…™s]

---

### ... but wait

- *[…™]
- *[k]
- *[p…™]
- *[pd…™]
- *[kpsd…™dspk]

---

### /s/ is the plural marker in English, right?

- [sk…™ps]

- [p…™ks]

- but...

- *[k…™ds]

	- Should be [k…™dz]
	
- *[k…™ss]
	
	- Should be [k…™s…™z]
---

### Wait.  So clearly the plural marker is more than just 'add an s'

- There are several versions, or "allomorphs", of the plural marking chunk (the 'morpheme')

- Is this just a memorized pattern?

- **What would /s/ become for new words?**

---

### The Wug Test

- Developed by Jean Berko Gleason

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonology/wugs.jpg">

---

### Now there is another one. There are two...

A) [w ågs]

B) [w ågz]

C) [w åg…™s]

D) [w åg…™z]

<section class="clicker"></section>

---

### What if it was a /w åk/? There are two...

A) [w åks]

B) [w åkz]

C) [w åk…™s]

D) [w åk…™z]

<section class="clicker"></section>

---

### What if it was a /w å É/? There are two...

A) [w å És]

B) [w å Éz]

C) [w å É…™s]

D) [w å É…™z]

### How do we know this?!

- ... and why are there three different versions of the plural marker in English?!

---

# Phonology

---


### Phonology

Phonology is the study of how sounds pattern in Language and languages

---

## What do phonologists study?

---

### Within-Language Phonological Questions

- What sounds differentiate words? (Phonemic Analysis)
	- ... and what do speakers hear as being ‚Äúthe same sound‚Äù?
  
- How do speakers tend to group sounds together? (Natural Classes)

- What combinations are ‚Äúlegal‚Äù or preferred in the language? (Phonotactics)

- How are syllables formed and what kinds are legal? (Syllable Structure)

- How do we assign stress, pitch, and emphasis? (Metrical Phonology)

- *How can we generate a theory that explains all of that?*

---

### Theoretical Linguistics

- In theoretical linguistics, we have three big questions:

	- "How can we model human language and grammar?"
	
	- "Do these models describe what humans are doing in real language?"
	
	- "Are these models cognitively real?"

---

### How do we model the patterns we see in language?

- Can we describe the patterns we're seeing through some linguistic analysis or abstraction?

---

### Sample models for Wug-taming
		
- Are we choosing a form among many which does the fewest things we don't like?

	- "Do we just hate [gs] and [ És] clusters and avoid them by replacing them with something else?"
		
- Are we just remembering the words we've heard said before, and doing the rest from analogy?

	- "Are you finding a form for /w åg+s/ by thinking about /m åg+s/?"
	
- Are we using rules that transform 'underlying' sounds into one another?

	- "Does some process change /s/ into [z] or […™z]?"
	
	- **We're going to take this approach in this class!**
			
---

### How do these various approaches handle *real data from real languages*?

- Do they **predict all the things** that really happen?
	
- Do they **avoid predicting crazy things** that *never* happen?

- How do they **account for exceptions** and other weird data?

- Do they work for **all languages**, or just a subset?

---

### Are these models cognitively real?

- Could they be naturally learned and acquired by humans?

- Do they depend on assumptions that some information is *innate*?
	
- Does this theory describe what's *actually happening* inside the human mind?

- ... or is it just a tool for describing how languages work, which doesn't claim to be how *humans* make the choices?

---

### We're going to just scrape the surface of theoretical questions

- ... but know that they're there, and they're *really* interesting.

---

### Phonology is not the same thing as phonetics

- Phoneticians are more concerned with the physical processes of speech

	- Articulation, Perception, and the cognitive processes underlying both

- Phonologists are more concerned with the patterns of sound structure in different languages

	- Markedness, phonotactics, rules, and cross-linguistic patterns

---

### You can learn about one by studying the other

- ... and phonetic laboratory methods for studying phonological problems is a booming world

- Phonetics üíï Phonology

---

### ... but they are deeply different fields

- Phonologists and phoneticians ask different questions

- We respect each other, and often hang out, but we're not doing the same thing

---

## You've just jumped out of a plane

![](img/parachute.jpg)

---

### Now, you collect data, write a grammar, and write a dictionary

- What are the meaningful chunks of words ('morphemes') in this language?

- What are the words in this language?

- How should this language be written?

- Decisions will need to be made

---

### One of the key questions you'll face is 'which sounds matter to speakers'

- Which sounds carry a *contrast*

- Which sounds *define words*

- Which sounds *cannot be changed without changing meanings*

---

### Phonemic Analysis

- Determining which sound changes *affect the meaning* of a word in a language

	- Phonemic Sounds

- ... which sound changes are *predictable*, and don't change word meanings

	- Allophonic Sounds

- ... and which sound variations are completely unpredictable and meaningless

	- Free variation
	
---

### We're going to look at this process using three different perspectives

- 1: By looking at data

- 2: By looking at perception

- 3: By looking at distributions

---

### This is a "threshold concept"

- That's why I'm covering it from three directions

- If you're struggling here, come to office hours

- It's normal and natural to struggle here

---

## Phonemic Analysis I: Let's use some data!

---

### "Oh no. There are sounds everywhere!"

- "People use a huge set of sounds, and I don't know which differences matter!"

- "What changes in sounds are *random*, and don't affect the meanings?"

- "What changes in sounds are *meaningful*, and change the meaning of a word?"

- "What changes in sounds can be *predicted* based on the other elements of the word, and don't change the meaning?"

- "What should I write down in my grammar or dictionary?"

---

### Does the difference between [t] and [tÃ™] change the meaning?

<table class="tg">
  <tr>
	<td class="tg-xldj">[tÃ™im]</td>
	<td class="tg-xldj">[tim]</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td class="tg-xldj">[tÃ™ap]</td>
	<td class="tg-xldj">[tap]</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

---

### It doesn't change the meaning and there's no pattern

- In English, it doesn't matter whether a /t/ is made as a dental sound [tÃ™] or an alveolar sound [t]

- Speakers can do two things and nobody particularly cares

- There's no pattern, no standard, just maddening chaos

- This is **free variation**.

---

### Does the difference between [k] and [p] change the meaning?

  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td class="tg-xldj">[kul]</td>
	<td class="tg-xldj">[pul]</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

---

### The meaning is changed, and there's no pattern

- When you change from /k/ to /p/, the meaning of the word changes

	- ... but we can't predict which will show up except by knowing the word we want

- We see 'minimal pairs' (e.g. /ki/ and /pi/) where that segment is the only thing that's changed.

- /k/ and /p/ are in a **contrastive** distribution

- They represent **two different phonemes**

---

### Does the difference between [ej] and [ej:] change the meaning?

### It doesn't change the meaning, but we can predict when it happens!

- Changing from a short to long [ej] doesn't change the meaning for speakers

- Vowel length is *predictable* based on the voicing of the next consonant

- Short and long vowels are in a **complementary** distribution

- They are **allophones of the same phoneme**

## Phonemic Analysis II: Let's think about perception

---

### Spanish speakers hear...

- # "Cabo"

- When somebody says either

- # [kabo] or [kaŒ≤o]
	
---
	
### Spanish speakers hear...

- # /b/

- When somebody says either

- # [b] or [Œ≤]

---

### English has two /l/ sounds

- Light l ([l] as in 'lip')

- 'Dark' or Velarized l ([…´] as in 'pill')

- The 'Dark' L happens at the end of a syllable

---

### English speakers hear...

- # "Pill"

- When somebody says either...

- # [p…™l] or [p…™…´]
	
---

### English speakers hear...

- # /l/

- When somebody says either...

- # [l] or […´]
	
---

### Speakers of language hear...

- # The phoneme

- When somebody says...

- # Any of the allophones of that phoneme

---

### Phonemes are groups of sounds which trade places predictably!

- ... and that trading is opaque to speakers

- The /l/ phoneme has two allophones in English: [l] and […´]

	- As in 'lip' and 'pill'

- The /t/ phoneme has many allophones in English: [t], [t ∞], [ î], [tÀ∫], […æ], […æÃÉ]

	- As in 'stop', 'top', 'button', 'cat', 'later', 'winter'

- Every sound produced is an allophone of some phoneme

	 - ... but not every phoneme has multiple allophones

---

D) üòï  I feel a bit confused.

E) üò≠  I feel completely lost!

---

## Phonemic Analysis III: Looking at distributions

---

### Allophones are *predictable*

- They always show up in specific environments, and don't affect the meaning of the word

- […±] shows up in English *only* when there's an /m/ before an /f/

	- 'Same' [sejm] but 'Symphony' [s…™…±f…ôni]

- [nÃ™] shows up in English *only* when there's an /n/ before an Interdental sound

	- 'Pine' [pajn] but 'Pine thug' [pajnÃ™ Œ∏ å…°]

- […´] shows up in MUSE *only* at the end of a syllable

- 'lip' [l…™p] but 'pill' [p…™…´]

---

### Allophones show up according to rules
	
- If a sound is *variant* that only shows up according to a *rule*, it's an allophone of another phoneme

---

### Phonemes are *unpredictable*

- There is no pattern which dictates where they show up

- They can occur in the same environments

- They form 'minimal pairs', different words which differ only in that sound

	- (or sometimes near minimal pairs e.g., te[√∞]er vs. mea[ í]ure)

---

### If a sound has its own identity in the language‚Äôs structure, it‚Äôs a phoneme.

- If it‚Äôs just another 'persona', it‚Äôs an allophone

---

### To determine this, consider a simple question...

---

## Is Will Batman?

- ![](people/will_batman_broken.jpg)

---

### How do you find out if your instructor is secretly Batman?

- You look at the distributions!

---

### If you see Batman and Will in the same context, they‚Äôre two different people.

- Finding two people talking to each other in the same place is a good indication that they're independent entities

- Two different personas can't be in the same place at the same time!

- They're in **contrastive** distribution

	- They happen in the same contexts

- If two sounds show up in an identical context, *they're independent phonemes*

---

### If you only see Will when there's no crime, and only see Batman where there's crime...

- This is a potential sign that Will *could be* the same being as Batman

- If Will runs into the bathroom when crime happens and Batman emerges, that's pretty good evidence

	- We call this an "alternation"

- They're in **complementary** distribution

	- One shows up in one context, the other in another context

- *If two sounds only show up in different contexts, or a sound suddenly changes, they're probably allophones of one phoneme*

---

### Complementary Distributions

(Batman and his alter-ego, Bruce Wayne)

![](img/batman.jpg)![](img/brucewayne.jpg)


---

### Contrastive Distribution

(Batman and Superman, two different heroes)
![](img/batmansuperman.jpg)

---

### So, to sum up the pop culture references...

- Batman and Bruce Wayne are really just one being

	- Bruce shows up in some circumstances, Batman in others
	
- [ej] and [ej:] are just one sound /ej/ in English phonology

	- [ej] shows up in some places, [ej:] shows up in other ones

- Batman and Will Styler are different individuals

	- ... or so Will wants you to think!
	
---

### So, that's three different perspectives on phonemic analysis

- You can look at the data and see when the meaning changes

- You can look at perception, and see what changes listeners "hear"

- You can look at the distribution, and see what sounds occur when.

## Cool.  So... how do we do phonemic analysis?

---

### Step 0: Check for minimal pairs

If you have a minimal pair where the meaning changes, the sounds are different phonemes and your work is done.  Always.

---

### If you have a minimal pair, the sounds are different phonemes and your work is done.

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/bankvault.jpg">

---

### Phonemic Analysis in four easy steps!

- 0: Check for Minimal Pairs, if none...

- 1: Collect all the environments the sound you‚Äôre interested in can occur in

- 2: State the distribution of the sounds. 

- 3: Decide which allophone is the basic *underlying* form
	
- 4: Write rules to derive the other allophone(s) from it based on environment

---

### 0: Check for Minimal Pairs, if none...

- Please.  PLEASE.

---

### 1: Collect all the environments the sound you‚Äôre interested in can occur in

- Write down what follows and precedes them

- Use __ to help focus your brain on the context

---

### 2: State the distribution of the sounds. 

- "This one occurs before/after/around/near __"
	
- Sometimes you can only describe where one happens

- Test hypotheses!

---

### 3: Decide which allophone is the basic *underlying* form

- Choose the one you can't predict

- Often it's the ‚Äúeverywhere else‚Äù allophone

---

### 4: Write rules to derive the other allophone(s) from it based on environment

- We'll talk about writing rules more shortly

---

### All sorts of environments trigger changes

- Adjacent sound or sounds

- Adjacent *types* of sound

- Word boundaries

- Syllable boundaries

- Sounds or later earlier in the word

	- This is a bit more rare, but really neat!

---

# Phonological Rules

---

### So, you've figured out that sounds are allophones of the same phoneme!

- They're in a *complementary* distribution

- You can predict which one will show up based on the environment

- **How do I express that prediction to somebody else?**

---

### Phonological Rules

You describe the distribution of the allophones of a phoneme with phonological rules

---

### Phonological Rule Format

- "X turns into Y in environment Z"

- ‚ÄúX -> Y‚Äù means ‚ÄúX turns into Y‚Äù

	- -> is an arrow, but just easier to type.

- Then the ‚Äú/‚Äù which means ‚Äúin the environment‚Äù

- Then you add a blank, representing where the sound goes that's getting transformed  ‚Äú__‚Äù

- ... And you position that blank relative to the conditioning environment.

---

### If /n/ turns to an /≈ã/ before velar sounds...

- /n/ -> [≈ã]  / __ [velar sounds]

- If it happened after velar sounds...

- /n/ -> [≈ã]  / [velar sounds] __

---

### Other Symbols

- "#" means ‚Äúthe boundary of a word‚Äù

- ‚ÄúV‚Äù means ‚Äúany vowel‚Äù 

- ‚ÄúC‚Äù means ‚Äúany consonant‚Äù

- "√∏" means "Nothing"

	- A /t/ being deleted is /t/ -> √∏ / ...

	- A /t/ being inserted is √∏ -> [t] / ...

---

### All of this is on your quick reference chart

- Use it!

---

### Some Phonological Rules

- /t/ -> [tÃ™] /__[dental C]

- /ej/ -> [ej:] / __[+voice]

- /V/ -> [VÃÉ] / __[nasal]

- Bruce Wayne --> Batman / [Crime]__[Crime]

---

### Often, you'll describe entire groups of sounds in your rules

- These groups will all share a 'feature'

	- 'voiceless', 'velar', 'consonants', 'high vowels'

- [stops] -> [fricatives] / __[back vowels]

- Any group of sounds which share an articulatory feature can be called a 'natural class'

- We'll talk more about these next time

---

### You'll hear about 'allomorphs'

- These are chunks of meaning ('morphemes') like the plural /s/ or past tense /d/ which change depending on nearby sounds

- The English plural "s" can be [s], [z], or […™z]

	- Cats, Dogs, and Dishes

- The English past tense "ed" can be [t], [d], or […ôd]

	- "Walked", "Buzzed", "Rounded"

---

### One solution to these data

### Nyet! There's a minimal pair!

- If 'l ≤et' and 'n ≤et' differ in meaning and differ only by that segment, they can't be allophones of the same phoneme!

### This one's awesome (and allophonic!)

- /d/ -> [√∞] / V__V

- Also, /b/ -> [Œ≤] / V__V

- And, /g/ -> […£] / V__V

- "Voiced stops become fricatives at the same place of articulation between vowels"

### Whoa.  You're doing Phonology!

- Amazing!

---

### Wrapping up

- Phonology is the study of how sounds pattern

- Phonemic analysis is how we determine which sounds have an identity in the language

	- ... and which are just personas of other sounds
	
- Will *may* be Batman

- Phonology is fun!

---

### Next time

- Four common phonological processes

- Phonotactics

- More data!
