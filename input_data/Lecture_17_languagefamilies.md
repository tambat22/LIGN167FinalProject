# Language Families!
### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---

### Today's Plan
	
* Languages and Dialects

* What are language families?

* How can languages be related? How can we tell?

- What are some of the major families?

- Are all languages related?

---

# Languages vs. Dialects

---

### How can we tell if people are speaking two dialects of the same language, or two different languages?

---

### This one's kind of tough!

---

## "Speakers understand each other!"

---

### Mutual Intelligibility

When two people can understand each other when talking.

---

### Mutual Intelligibility!

* English speakers understand English speakers

* Russian speakers understand Russian speakers

* Russian speakers *don't* understand English speakers

---

### This sounds promising!

---

### Dialect Continuum

A geographical continuum of speakers where nearby speakers understand each other, but distant speakers might not.

---

---

### Mutual Intelligibility

* Moroccan Arabic speakers don't understand Egyptian Arabic speakers

	* (Unless they write the message down)

* Ukrainian speakers understand Russian speakers (and vice versa)

	- But Ukrainian speakers understand Belorussian speakers better still

* Swedish, Danish and Norwegian speakers all understand each other

* Brazilian Portuguese speakers understand Spanish better than the other way around

	* ("Asymmetrical Mutual Intelligiblity")

* Do speakers of Amish English understand rural New Zealand speakers?

---

### OK, so what else?

---

## "They use the same writing system!"

---

### Shared Writing Systems

* Literate English speakers use the same writing system!

	* (... the same one as Tagalog, Romanian, Vietnamese)

* Russian and Mongolian both use Cyrillic

* Moroccan and Yemeni Arabic have a writing system in common, but little else.

---

## "Speakers agree they're speaking the same language!"

---

<lang>Serbo-Croatian</lang><br><ldata>IE:SW-Slavic - The Balkans</ldata> 

* Also known as "Serbo-Croat" or "BCS"

* Spoken in Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro

* Up until the 1990s, there were four dialects, one for Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro

* Yugoslavia broke apart in an exceptionally bloody war

* Now they’re four different languages spoken by four different peoples in four different countries

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/bcsmap.png"> 

---

### So we have...

- Different Dialects which could be languages, but are dialects

    - (Moroccan and Egyptian Arabic)

- Languages which could be dialects, but are languages

    - (BCS, or Hindi and Urdu)

- Different Languages where speakers understand each other

    - (Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish)

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/relationshipcomplicated.png"> 

---

### So what *really* makes a language different from a dialect?

---

## *“A language is a dialect with an Army and a Navy”*
<small> Popularized by Max Weinreich </small>

---

**Calling something a language or a dialect is a political choice, not a linguistic one**

* If you want to unite yourself with a group, they’re speaking a dialect of your language

* If you want to distance yourself from a group, they’re speaking another language

* *... but we still have to describe the linguistic relationship!*

* **Sister Languages** - English, German, Dutch, Swedish

* **Mother Language** - Proto-Germanic!

# How can we figure out these relations?

---

## "Will, how are baby languages made?"

---

### Well, when speakers love a language very much...

* Speakers of a language inhabit a wide area 

* Groups of speakers become geographically or culturally isolated

* The languages changes naturally, but *differently for each group*!

* Let a few hundred years pass, and bam, languages.

### Sound correspondences

* We look for common *patterns* of correspondence

* Sounds will change based on how they're produced

	* /d, n, l/ will often change around

	* (as in the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota languages)

* Systematic sound correspondence with cognates is a slam-dunk case for language relation

---

### Shared linguistic features

If a bunch of languages do things in a certain way, they may be related.

* Five languages nearby with a Vocative case?  Prolly related.

* 8 languages with tone, surrounded by languages without tone?  It's a solid bet.

---

If you have a few of these things, shared among some languages, you may have a...

### Language Family

A group of languages which share a common ancestor

## How do we find deeper language ancestry?

---

### Finding language ancestry

* 1: Find related languages

* 2: Reconstruct the mother tongue!

---

### Language Reconstruction

The process of looking at daughter languages and guessing what structures, sounds, and words the mother language must have had.

* An art, not a science

---

### We do this all the time!

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/weasleys.jpg">  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Reconstructing words

* 1: Find cognates

* 2: Reverse sound changes

* 3: Note borrowings

* 4: When all else fails, go with the most common form in the daughters

---

### Reconstructing grammar

* 1: Look at the grammatical patterns and structures present

* 2: Find the ones that are shared among the languages

* 3: Pick a shared pattern or structure

* 4: For those that lack (or have) the pattern or structure, try and explain why

	* (Maybe influence from another language, or a conflicting pattern)

* 5: Assume that structures present in a majority of daughters were also present in the mother
---

<lang>Proto-Indo-European</lang><br><ldata>Indo-European - ???</ldata> 

* *wem-, *h₁reug- - 'to vomit'

* *wāt-, *weh₁- - 'to blow'

* *pneu- - 'to breathe'

* *(s)mei- - 'to laugh'

* *ǵhasto-, *ǵhazdho- - 'stick'

	* (According to Watkins 2000)
---

### What's the Catch?

<danger>***Reconstruction assumes regularity!***</danger>

---

### Reconstruction will fail if...

* Sounds changed unpredictably

	* "Ooh, I like /ɠ/, let's use that!"

* Change happened for non-predictable reasons

	* "We got rid of that verb form because it sounds too much like "Michael Bay", and did you see what he did to the Transformers franchise?"

* Coincidence

	* If more languages got rid of an earlier structure than kept it, we may pretend it's a new thing

* *... and we may never know if it's failed!*

---

### ... but it's still our best chance!

* So, when we're looking into relations between languages...

---

### Finding language ancestry

* 1: Find related languages

* 2: Reconstruct the mother tongue!

* 3: Then, compare that to other mother languages.

* 4: Then, the mothers' mothers...

* 5: If they have words, features, or structures in common, you've got a family!

# What are some of the major language families?

---

## Indo-European (~3.2 Billion Speakers)

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/iefamilies.png"> 

---

## Indo-European (~3.2 Billion Speakers) 

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/iefamiliesmap.png">  

---

## Sino-Tibetan (~1.4 Billion Speakers)

- Includes Chinese, Burmese, Tibetan

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/sinotibetan.jpg"> 

---

## Niger-Congo Languages (~519 Million Speakers)

- Includes Swahili, Igbo, Fula, Zulu, and Zarma

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/nigercongomap.png"> 

---

## Afroasiatic Languages (~500 Million Speakers)

- Includes Arabic, Hausa, Oromo, Amharic, Somali, Hebrew

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/afroasiatic.png"> 

---

## Austronesian Languages (~386 Million Speakers)

- Includes Malay, Tagalog, Malagasy, Cham, Hawaiian, Maori

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/austronesian.jpg"> 

---

### That's just the top five

... there are many, MANY more language families

---

## Language Families of Indigenous America

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/americadiversitymap.png">  

---

### Indigenous Language Speakers are still here!

- As of 2010, 370,000+ people reported speaking an Indigenous language in the US

- 130,000+ in Canada

- Millions more in Central America

- Many tribes and groups are working actively to reclaim and increase use of the languages

- Linguists within and collaborating these groups are collaborating towards these goals

---

### Despite our Government's best efforts

- Displacing and combining groups to disrupt identity and force reliance

- 83% of Indigenous children were forced into 'Boarding Schools' in the US

	- 'Kill the Indian in him...and save the man.' - Richard Henry Pratt, 1892

- Children who spoke their language or engaged in cultural practices were beaten and sometimes killed, taught shame over their identity

- These schools continued running through the 1970s, with 10 of them in CA

	- Here's [an article about one in Riverside](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/california-bears-the-painful-scars-of-native-american-boarding-schools/)

	- This was also used extensively in Canada

---

### Be careful with narratives of 'extinct' languages

- Languages often do not 'die naturally'

- People still exist who know them and know of them

- Nothing is lost that is not forgotten, and Indigenous people are still here

	- The process is not over

- Do not let the people who tried to kill these groups claim to mourn and move on

## Language Families of Amazonas

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/amazonas_langs.jpg">  

---

## Language Families of the Caucasus

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/caucasianmap.png">  

---

Wow... that's a lot of language families!

- ### Do all languages have relatives?

---

# Do all languages have relatives?

---

### Yes, but we don't always know what they are!

---

## Linguistic Isolates

Languages where we have found no contemporary relatives or ancestors

---

### Basque

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/basqueregion.jpg"> 

---

### Other well-known(ish) isolates

* Ainu (spoken in Japan)

* Karok (spoken in California)

* Korean (spoken in Korea)

* Natchez (spoken in MS/LA, now OK)

* Zuni (spoken in New Mexico)

---

# ... but aren't all languages related?

---

### "Proto Human"/"Proto World"

The postulated human mother-tongue

---

### Proto-World is mostly the domain of crackpots

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/crackpot.jpg"> 

---

### Proto-World

- This requires reconstructing based on reconstruction

- No written records have been found to exist

	- lol.

- This makes the assumption that humans only developed language once!

---

### Wrapping Up

* 'Language' vs. 'Dialect' is political, not linguistic

* Dialects of a 'mother language' which grow apart become 'daughter languages'

* This begets 'language families'

* We find these relations by looking for cognates, sound correspondences, shared features, and by doing reconstruction

* We can't always find relatives for languages.
