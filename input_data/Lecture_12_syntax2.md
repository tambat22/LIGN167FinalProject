### "I know the homework is due in a few hours but I just started and I have some questions..."

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/done_cormac.jpg">

- Students who start the homework within a few hours of the due date generally fail the assignment

# Syntax 2: Phrase Structure Rules

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---
			  
### Today's Plan

- Phrase Structure Rules

- Tree Planting

---

### Last time, we talked about constituents

- Noun Phrases

- Verb Phrases

- Prepositional Phrases

---

### ... and we realized that the world of syntax isn't flat

- (Neither is the rest of the world, damnit)

---

### Now, let's think a bit more about those structures

---

# Phrase Structure Rules

---

### We have intuitions about what can be inside a noun phrase in English...

- The big, strong rhinoceros

- &#42;The big, quickly rhinoceros

- &#42;The strong, charged rhinoceros

---

### Same thing with a prepositional phrase in English

- I saw her outside the barn

- &#42;I saw her outside fall over

- &#42;I saw her outside beautiful

---

### Even a verb phrase has constraints in English

- I hugged the small kitten

- &#42;I small hugged the kitten

- &#42;I hugged gently the kitten (???)

---

### And sentences definitely have rules in English

- Sam sent Amanda to the store.

- &#42;Sent Sam Amanda to the store.

- &#42;Amanda Sam to the store sent.

---

### Unless Yoda you are

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/yoda.jpg">

---

### So, English has rules about how phrases are built

- ... that sounds useful!

---

### A good theory of syntax does two things

- 1: It can generate all of the sentences that speakers of a language think are grammatical

- 2: It will *not* generate sentences that speakers of a language think are *ungrammatical*

---

### Today, we'll talk about a *very* basic approach to this

---

# <danger>HUGE DISCLAIMER</danger>

- Syntax is **huge**

- We are only teaching you a small part of it to handle a small number of sentences.

	- The rules you will have do *not* suffice for most complex sentences

- The handout shows the rules *we will use*.

	- There are other sets. Trust nobody else, not even the book!

- I'm going to be saying "Don't worry about that" a lot this quarter!

- Consider LIGN 101 syntax to be a teaser for LIGN 121, where you'll get a bigger picture

	- ... and a different set of rules!

---

### Phrase Structure Rules

- Rules that describe the sub-elements which can form a given syntactic constituent

	- ... and their ordering

- We're going to talk in terms of "building trees"

	- But really, we're building sentences

- **Syntax trees are built from phrase structure rules!**

---

### Phrase structure rule format

- X &rarr; Y Z

- S &rarr; NP VP

	 - "A sentence is composed of an NP, followed by a VP"
   
<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_snpvp.jpg">

---

### Phrase structure rules are like building blocks of sentences

- We build sentences by building chunks using PS rules

	- Then combining them into the desired larger forms

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/tangrams.jpg">

---

### A Note on Notation

- We're going to talk about NP, N', and N

	- These are three different things
	
- NP (/ɛn pi/ or "Noun Phrase")

- N' or N̄ ("N-Bar", /ɛn bɑɹ/)

	- N' and N̄ are two ways of writing the same thing
	
- N ("Noun", /ɛn/)

- The symbols &rarr; and -> mean the same thing

---

# How do we build trees?

---

### Building a phrase structure tree (Part 1)

- Step 1: Find constituents and think about what *kinds* of phrases they are

	- "Huh, this is a preposition. There's gotta be a PP around here..."

- Step 2: Start from S and move down the tree, stitching together according to our PS rules

	- Some folks work *up*, starting from individual phrases

	- ***The top node is always S***

---

### Building a phrase structure tree (Part 2)

- Step 3: Check to make sure every branching obeys the phrase structure rules

	- "OK, this is Rule 9, now rule 1 to 2, then here's 11..."

- Step 4: A beautiful tree will be grown!

---

### Some tree-drawing rules

- You always branch downwards

	- If a branch is moving upwards, you're doing it wrong

- Lines should *never* cross

	- They don't need to. If you think they need to, you're doing it wrong.
	
- You will not need to do any three-way branching for LIGN 101

	- Every branch will have either one or two connections down.

- Some branches may have two words (but not on your homeworks!)

	- Compounds or phrases without internal structure "Mai Tai" or "Will Styler" or "back up"

- <danger>Use the Phrase Structure Rules we gave you on the handout.</danger>

### How do we deal with adjectives?

---

### Rule 4) N' -> ADJ N'

- We can combine Rule 1, Rule 4, and Rule 3...

### ... Rule 4 is recursive!

- The N' contains another N'!

- It can apply as many times as you need!

### Rule 11: VP -> VP PP

This one's recursive too!

### Complementizers put sentences within sentences

- Words like "that", "when", "if", "while", "as", and more

---

### Rule 7: S -> NP VP
### Rule 12: VP -> V CP
### Rule 13: CP -> C S

---

### (Don't worry, that last one was mostly just me having fun)

- You'll be doing much simpler trees on tests and homeworks

---

### Do not be tempted by darkness

---

## Where you attach things changes the meaning!

---

### Be careful where you put your prepositional phrases!

- There are multiple 'legal' places to attach a given prepositional phrase

- ... but where you attach prepositional phrases changes the meaning

- Sometimes the difference is subtle, but often it isn't!

## Drawing Trees

---
### How do you draw phrase structure trees?

- **Only Electronically!**

	- This makes for fewer scanning and legibility issues

- Pros tend to use LaTeX, but that's fancy

- Or using a tool like <http://ironcreek.net/phpsyntaxtree/> 

	- You'll need to use bracket notation for that
	
	- It's frustrating at first, but it does the job
	
- This is a friendly tool <https://groverburger.github.io/sapling/>

### I've made a video tutorial for creating these trees using [jsSyntaxTree](https://ironcreek.net/syntaxtree/)

### Let's Practice ([if we have time](http://savethevowels.org/talks/l101_12_syntax2.html#/106))

"The grumpy polar bears from LA hated the excruciating traffic on the 405."

---

### "The grumpy polar bears from LA hated the excruciating traffic on the 405."

Let's break it down!

---

### The grumpy polar bears

* Rule 1 -> Rule 4 -> Rule 4 -> Rule 3

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbears1.jpg">

---

### From LA

* Rule 6 -> Rule 2 -> Rule 3

---
<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbears2.jpg">

---

### The grumpy polar bears from LA

* Combine the PP and NP using Rule 5

---
<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbears3.jpg">

---


### The excruciating traffic

* Rules 1, 4, 3

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbears4.jpg">

---


### On the 405

* Rule 6 -> Rule 1 -> Rule 3

---
<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbears5.jpg">

---

### The excruciating traffic on the 405

* Rule 5 to combine the two chunks

---
<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbears6.jpg">

---

### hated the excruciating traffic on the 405

* A little bit of Rule 9's all I need

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbears7.jpg">

---

### "The grumpy polar bears from LA hated the excruciating traffic on the 405."

- Rule 7, then BOOM!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbearsfull.jpg">

---

### For Next Time

- We'll do a bit more tree practice


- We'll touch on some of the many things we're leaving behind in Syntax
