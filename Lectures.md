# Linguistics 101: An Introduction to Language
### Dr. Will Styler

---

### Today's Plan

- Introductions

---

# Introductions

---

## Dr. Will Styler

Teaching Professor, Linguist, Gigantic Nerd

<img class="r-stretch" src="people/will.jpg">

---

## IA Introductions

---

## We are Linguists!

- Gigantic professional language nerds

---

### We're going to learn how we linguists talk about Language

- We'll talk about what Language is

- We'll talk about different aspects of languages

- We'll talk about the subfields which tackle different problems in Language

- We'll talk about the various tools and techniques that Linguists use

- We'll look at actual language data to get a sense of just how complicated all this is

- We'll have lots of fun* in the process

---

### That's what this course is about

---

## How will we teach this class?

---

### We'll teach you here, in section, and in office hours

- Here, we'll talk about concepts and address questions

- In section, you'll dive deep with language data

	- Please attend your designated section
	
	- If you'd like to try and attend a different section, email that section's IA
	
- Office hours are your home to clarify concepts

	- We have a massive number of combined office hours, use them!
	
---

### You'll check your learning using homework, exams, and clickers

- Six homeworks

- A Final Exam (held in this room, ideally!)

- WebClicker questions

---

## Let's look at the syllabus

---

## Clicking

---

### You'll need an account on <webclicker.web.app>

- Register using the course code **FBPURC**

- You can click in with any web-attached device

---

### This is a clicker question!

### When should you tell Will about any special accommodations you'll need?

A) Within the first two weeks

B) By the end of the quarter

C) When I'm freaking out about my grade at the end of the quarter
			  
D) I won't tell him, then pretend I did when it's an issue at the end of the quarter

### Coming to lecture isn't magic

- You'll probably want to take notes

	- Don't write down the words I say, write down the ideas

	- Summarize in your own words

	- Slides are available on the syllabus

- Write down questions you have during the lecture

- We as a species are awful at multitasking
	- That's right.  Close Discord.
	- Or just be prepared to re-study later

---

### We're back in meatspace!

- **Masks are strongly recommended, but not required.**

- Here's hoping it stays that way

	- We have a plan in place, in case it doesn't

- Come to class healthy and prepared

- **You have no excuse to come to class sick!**

	- The attendance policy is lax, and you can always just podcast.

---

### Pro-Tip: Sincere effort is incredibly important to me

- 'Blow off' the class, or try to lawyer or cajole your way into an A, and you'll find much no sympathy nor help

	- Low effort, low integrity, or 'cut-corners' work insults the people who you need help from
	
- Put in the effort for us, and we’ll put in effort for you

	- We will bend over backwards to help students who are making a sincere effort

- **If you're struggling, talk to us ASAP**

---

## Any questions?

---

# So, what is Linguistics?

* (Most people have *zero* clue)

---

### "Oh, you're a linguist?  Cool!"

## "How many languages do you speak?"   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

Many linguists speak more than one language, but...

### There's way more to Linguistics than knowing languages <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Linguists study Language

* We're interested in how 'Language' works for humans

	- ... and we study it by looking at Spanish, or Laotian, or Russian, or Kumeyaay

* Learning languages can be a part of that, but it's not the whole!

---

### We're interested in Capital L 'Language'

- ... even as we're studying individual languages

---

... but we have a problem ...

---

## Language is amazingly complex

---

### "The duck quacked gleefully at his bae."

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/bird_mallard.jpg">

---

### "The duck quacked gleefully at his bae."

- How did I make that sequence of sounds and how did you recognize it?

- Why is there a [t] at the end of quack rather than a [d]?

- What does that last sound mean anyways?

- Who quacked at whom?  When?  How do we know?

- What was gleeful?

- Is the duck single? Happy?

- What's a 'bae' anyways? Can a duck have a bae?

---

### (Yes, my slang and memes are dated)

- You'll get the chance to help me in future homework assignments

- <img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/fellowkids.gif">

---

### Language is complex

* ## Linguistics has to be complex too

---

### We'll look at all the complexities

- We'll look at many of the central subfields of Linguistics

- We'll examine other questions that we linguists are also interested in.

---

### What elements of Linguistics will we cover this quarter?

- "How does talking work?" - Phonetics

- "How do sounds change when we combine them?" - Phonology

- "How do we build words?" - Morphology

- "How do we combine words into sentences?" - Syntax

- "What does it all mean?" - Semantics and Pragmatics

---

### What *won't* we cover this quarter

- "How do I have better grammar and be more articulate?"

- "How does Poetry work? Why do some sentences sound more beautiful?"

- "How do I learn languages more quickly and effectively?"

- "How can I become an English-to-Japanese translator?"

- "How does French, or Spanish, or Russian, or Wichita work?"

---

So, that's what we're doing here

---

# Why on Earth does anybody care about Linguistics?

---

### There are a million answers to that question

- Every linguist has their own

	- ... and you'll have your own
	
	- ... when you become a linguist
	
---

![](humorimg/inevitable.jpg)

---

### I'll give you two answers

- Because Linguists do interesting things

- Because Language is AWESOME

---

# Linguists do interesting things!

---

## Theoretical Linguistics

---

### Theoretical Linguistics

- How can we describe *how people communicate*?

- How can we describe *the things people don't do*?

- What are the best models to help us understand language?

- What are the best models which mirror our own cognition?

- How does language change over time?

---

### Linguistic Typology

- How do languages *generally* accomplish communicative goals?  

- Are there patterns across the world?

- What kinds of things are languages more and less likely to do?

- Are there *universal* tendencies in language?

---

## Languages differ in how they put sounds together

---

<lang>English</lang><br><ldata>I-E, Germanic, West Germanic - All over the place</ldata>

'Strengths'  (/stɹɛŋkθs/)

---

<lang>Russian</lang><br><ldata>I-E, Slavic, East - Russia</ldata>

‘Glance’ - Всгляд (/vzglʲat/)

‘Of Construction’ - строительств (/strʌˈʲitʲɛlʲstf/)

---

<lang>Czech</lang><br><ldata>I-E, Slavic, West, Czech-Slovak - The Czech Republic</ldata>


Strč prst skrz krk

‘Stick your finger down your throat’

---

## Not all languages use the same modality!

---

### Spoken languages use speech to express meanings

- We're familiar with this!

- ... but even 'spoken' language involves gesture and visual cues!

---

### Written language is used to express meanings

- Like this!

- Not all languages have writing systems

- Some different languages use the same writing system

- Some people can only understand each other in writing

---

### Signed languages use gesture, facial expression, and movement  to express meanings

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/asl_pourdrink.gif">

[Source: Sign with Robert](https://giphy.com/signwithrobert)

---

### Other languages are felt!

- Braille is a touch-based writing system for English

- [ProTactile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfICNTq6ITY) is an emerging language designed to be used by folks who are both Deaf and Blind.

- Other forms of communication which rely on touch exist!

## Languages differ in how they work with words

'Mamihlapinatapai'

* "a look shared by two people, each wishing that the other will offer something that they both desire but are unwilling to suggest or offer themselves."[<src>[1]</src>](http://www.wordfocus.com/mamihlapinatapai.html)

---

<lang>Turkish</lang><br><ldata>Turkic - Turkey</ldata>

* 'gel-di'	"He came"	   	

* 'gel-miş'	"He came, to the best of my knowledge"

---

## Linguists study *all* language, not just 'proper' language

---

### New language has studyable meaning too!

- rizz
	- "Will may not have enough rizz to get away with using Gen-Z slang."

- sus 
	- "I'm pretty sus about some of his theories."

- uwu
	- "I am going to UwU this presentation!"

- bussin
	- "As gas prices rise, more students are bussin to campus"
	
- simp
	- "That test was simp, I was done in ten minutes"
	
---

### I know what you're thinking...

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/cringe.gif">

---

### This shows we have intuitions about all language use!

- We can talk about any words, even new words, being grammatical or not

- We know when *any* language that we use is being used properly

- Words have legitimate and 'correct' meanings, even if they're not in the dictionary

- The -ussy suffix (e.g. bussy, pizzussy) was the American Dialect Society's 2022 'Word of the Ear'

- All language is language!

---

### Let's try that again

- rizz
	- "She seduced her with AI Generated romantic texts.  ChatGPT got W rizz."

- sus
	- "Will's knowledge of Gen-Z slang is still pretty sus."

- uwu
	- uwu is not an adjective but an attitude.  winguwistics!

- bussin
	- "These newer slang examples are bussin"
	
- simp
	- "Don't be a simp, Chomsky will never cite you even if you mention him 500 times."
	
---

### So, there you go

That's why we care.

## My goal for this course

# What is Language?

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---

### Today's Plan

- Who are you?

- What is Language?

- What are some characteristics of Language?

- How Universal is Language?

- What *isn't* language?

- Does our language shape our thoughts?

---

# Who are you?

---

### Information I'd like

- Year
- Major
- What languages do we speak?

---

# What is Language?

---

### Language

- Language is a system for linking expression to meaning

- ... but we're probably better off thinking about what makes language, language-like

---

# What characteristics does Language have?

---

### Three important characteristics of Language

- 1 - Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified

- 2 - Fully Productive and Creative

- 3 - Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

---
### Characteristic #1

## Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified

---

### Language has 'signs' and 'signified' concepts

- The 'sign' is something a human does in communication

- The 'signified' is something in the world (conceptual or concrete)

- *What is the link between these things?*

---

### Non-arbitrary signs

- *The sign is causally linked to the signified*

- Smoke is a sign of fire

- Bleeding from your finger is a sign of a papercut

- Will's presence is a sign of bad puns 

---

### Iconic (or representational) signs

- *A referential abstraction from the signified* 

- # ☂ ☃ ☀ 💩 🤦‍ 

- Some hand gestures

- Some sounds meant to 'mimic' the world
 
---

<img class="big" src="img/curve.jpg">

---

### Arbitrary Signs

- *Referential only by agreement and widespread knowledge*

- Non-representational symbols (or uses of symbols) (♄, 🍆, 🍑)

- Non-iconic gestures

---

![](img/scotland_speedsign.jpg)

- "Go whatever speed is legal here"

### 🔥 in 'omg that party was 🔥  🔥  🔥 ' is ...

A) Non-Arbitrary, Iconic

B) <correct>Arbitrary</correct>

---

### The most important arbitrary signifiers are...

---

## Words!

- The connection between words and meanings in language is (mostly) arbitrary

---

			  
### The connection between sound and meaning is mostly arbitrary in spoken Language

<img width=300px src=img/koala.jpg><img width=500px  src=phonmedia/koalas.png>

---

### Signed languages have arbitrary signs too!
(These ASL examples are from [Sign with Robert on GIPHY](https://giphy.com/signwithrobert/))

---

### ... but there are often elements of iconicity in signs

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/asl_dead.gif">

---

### Spoken language has moments of iconicity too!

---

### Onomatopoeia

*Words which, when spoken, sound kind of like the things they represent*

* (See also the idea of an [Ideophone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideophone))

---

### Onomatopoetic Words in English

Boom   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Gurgle   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Woof   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Snip   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Whoosh   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Splash  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Onomatopoeia differs across languages 
		
---

### A rooster says...

cock-a-doodle-doo (English)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

kukko kiekuu (Finnish)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

chicchirichí (Italian)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

kuklooku (Urdu)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

kukuriku (Hungarian)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Sourced from [this awesome site](http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/personal/dabbott/animal.html)

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

(So, different languages can't even map sounds onto sounds uniformly)

---

### The best evidence for arbitrariness: Words differ across languages

- If the link between signifier and signified were non-arbitrary, *everybody would have substantially similar words for concepts*

---

### Spoiler Alert: We do not
<img class="r-stretch" src="img/fish_dieter.jpg">

---

### Characteristic #1

## Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified

---

### Characteristic #2

## Languages are fully productive and creative

---

### Let's test that out

- Let's describe an image that you've never seen before

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/stablediffusion_beach_san_diego_kitten_spaceship_silverware_motorcycle_dinosaur__by_Thomas_Kinkade_Seed-5923967_Steps-50_Guidance-14.jpg">

---

### This was not created by a human, so it doesn't follow human categories

- This was generated by [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion)

- The prompt was 'beach san diego kitten spaceship silverware motorcycle dinosaur by Thomas Kinkade'

- This is one of the weirdest natural language processing examples around!

	- **Yet we can still describe the output!**

---

### Languages are capable of describing anything (eventually)

- Might take time

- Might require some words to be 'circumlocuted' or invented

	- "I don't know a word for this, but I'll use other words to describe what I'm after'

- Might require incredible skill

	- "They should have sent a poet"

- But they'll get the job done

---

### Languages are also capable of producing an infinite set of unique sentences

- Any human speaker of a language can produce a sentence that nobody has ever spoken before

	- "I plan to buy a half-empty barrel of Doritos as soon as my penguin gets home with the Crown Jewels."

	- "I sure am glad that Michael Bay has agreed to direct a movie adaptation of my favorite childhood cartoon"

---

### ... and sentences can be infinitely grown and expanded

- I saw Anna.

- I saw Anna yesterday.

- I saw Anna yesterday before I refilled the hummingbird feeder.

- I saw Anna yesterday afternoon right after writing a bad pun but before I refilled the hummingbird feeder.

- I saw my neighbor Anna who likes to hug polar bears yesterday afternoon right after writing a bad pun but before I refilled the hummingbird feeder.

---

### This particular property is called recursion

- Sentences can be made to contain elements from other sentences infinitely

- "My cat saw the guy who went with Kati, Vincent, and Victoria to the park where the New York Knicks talked to Mary..."

- This can go on literally *forever*

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/hulkhoganfractal.jpg">

---

### Creativity and Productivity is true of all languages

- We have yet to discover a language which is communicatively 'primitive' or unable to describe reality

- If a language lacks elements, they will be developed or borrowed over time

- Languages can differ substantially still

- A given language may lack words for some concepts

	- ... or may have words that other languages don't have

	- Many words and concepts are culturally based, and may not be shared regardless

- **Every natural human language that we've found is able to express a rich set of meanings**

---

### Characteristic #2

## Languages are fully productive and creative

---

### Characteristic #3

## Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

---

### Grammaticality Judgements

- Some things sound 'like English' and are comprehensible

- Some things are not English

---

### You can make grammaticality judgements

- 'John went to the park with Tamara'

- 'Walk Rick gate Johnny between'

- 'The moose fiendishly decalcified the hieroglyphics between the Dagestani Giraffes'

- 'Somebody set up us the bomb. All your base are belong to us.'

---

### Grammaticality judgements are about language, not individual words

- 'Gleeble' - A small fish

- 'To Garflabble' - To perform an elaborate mating display

- 'Flundubble' - A large octopus-like creature

---
'Gleeble' - A small fish

'To Garflabble' - To perform an elaborate mating display

'Flundubble' - A large octopus-like creature

<section class="clicker"></section>

### Is the sentence 'Twelve Flundubble garflabbling gleeble.' grammatical?

A) Yes

B) No

---
'Gleeble' - A small fish

'To Garflabble' - To perform an elaborate mating display

'Flundubble' - A large octopus-like creature

### Is the sentence 'Gleebles garflabble for flundubbles all the time.' grammatical?

A) Yes

B) No

---

### (and by the way, how do we know the plural of 'gleeble'?)

---

![](humorimg/conspiracykeanu.jpg)

* (Nah, it's just phonology)

---

### Is the following sequence grammatical?

---

### How about this one?

---

### Judgements can be more subtle

- ?There looks to be a problem outside
- ?There sounds to be somebody in there
- ?There smells to be something rotten in there
- ?There feels to be something in the bag
- ?There tastes to be an issue with the cookies

---

### We as speakers have strong feelings about the 'correctness' and 'rules' of language

- ... but not so much for other kinds of basic communicative gestures

- So, this is yet another element of Language

---

### Characteristic #3

## Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

---

### There are other characteristics that are important in human Language

- Language is symmetrical (e.g. we can send and recieve)

- Language can talk about situations not in the 'here and now'

- Language is made of discrete, isolateable units (like words or sounds)

- Language has slang, taboo words

- Language accomplishes certain functions (e.g. asking questions, issuing commands)

- All languages can be translated into any other

- But the three we'll focus on are...

---
### Three important characteristics of Language

- 1 - Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified

- 2 - Fully Productive and Creative

- 3 - Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

- **All human languages share these properties!**

---

### Given that human languages seem to share some properties

- ... and we're yet to find a group of humans without language

- Some theorists have argued that this is evidence for...

---

# Universal Grammar

---

### Universal Grammar

- An idea initially posited by Noam Chomsky

---

### A Note on the Noam

![](people/noam_chomsky.jpg)

---

### Universal Grammar

An idea initially posited by Noam Chomsky

- UG holds that there's some genetic basis to human language

- Some properties of human language are innate

	- Not just the ones to do with physical structures

- There are a set of constraints governing language that are 'built in' to our physiology

---

### UG is not facts about your individual language

- A child of two Mandarin Chinese speakers, raised by English speakers, will speak English

- Every language is *not* the same, and linguistic grammar varies substantially

- *UG is about biological predisposition to Language, not to A language*

---

### Evidence for UG

- No cultures, people, or societies have been found with no language

- No other species has been found with human-like language

- Children acquire language impressively well

	- Even in cultures where people don't speak to children
	
- Signed languages show similar properties to spoken languages

	- Even when they arise in isolation
	
- Some things appear to be universal

	- The big one is Recursion
	
---

### Evidence against UG

- There doesn't seem to be good biological evidence for it

- Many properties of human language can be derived from functional facts about communication

- Recursion might not be universal
  
	- Dan Everett (and others) claim that speakers of Pirahã lack recursion
	- Pirahã is a pretty neat language

- [Even Chomksy doesn't support this view anymore](https://dlc.hypotheses.org/1269)

---

### Are elements of Linguistic structure innate?

- There was a major change between the 9th (2010) and 11th (2018) editions of the textbook

	- Innatist arguments have gone from 'unquestioned' to 'questionable' in the field

- Lots of smart folks have lined up on both sides of this argument

	- ... and there's no sign of a consensus yet!
	
- I just want you to know the idea behind UG
	
---

### But we've now got a pretty good handle on what Language is

---

# What *isn't* Language

---

### Alternative means of coding languages

- [Semaphore](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/semaphore.htm) and Morse Code

	- These are just re-coding an existing language

- Writing systems

	- They're closely associated with an existing spoken or signed human language

---

### Computer Programming Languages

- Languages like COBOL, C++, Java, Python, Rust

---
<img class="r-stretch" src="img/cpluspluscalc.png">
---

### Are programming languages languages?

- 1 - Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified

- 2 - Fully Productive and Creative

- 3 - Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

---

### Are programming languages languages?

<correct>1 - Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified</correct>

2 - Fully Productive and Creative

3 - Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

---
### Are programming languages languages?

<correct>1 - Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified</correct><br>

<danger>2 - Fully Productive and Creative</danger><br>

3 - Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language

### Are programming languages languages?

<correct>1 - Arbitrary relationships between signs and the signified</correct><br><br>

<danger>2 - Fully Productive and Creative</danger><br><br>

<correct>3 - Speakers have knowledge of grammar and the 'rules' of language</correct>

---

So, no.

* ### (Current) Computer Programming languages are not Language

---

### (Sorry, Hal)

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/hal9000.jpg">

---

## Do any non-humans have language?

---

## Yes, but only one so far

---

### Large Language Models can produce human language

- Large Transformer-based Neural language models (like ChatGPT or OpenAssistant) are now capable of producing robust, grammatical, and used-as-humans-would language

- They have 'passed the bar' for many linguists as competent language users
	- Most of the historical problems language models faced are now 'solved'
	- *This is different than saying 'These are true AI'*

- [They are much less efficient language learners than children](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07998)
	- ... and work is ongoing to see whether they can do more with less

---

### Aside: ChatGPT has no plausible 'universal grammar'

- The code doesn't include grammatical facts, a 'language organ', or innate grammatical patterns

- English models have accidentally learned some other languages
	- (e.g. it appears to be able to use one languages' patterns to generalize)

- [Some UG Folks are still fighting](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/noam-chomsky-chatgpt-ai.html) (also [this](https://mronline.org/2023/04/24/chatgpt-and-human-intelligence-noam-chomsky-responds-to-critics/))

---

## There is finally another kind of thing which can do human language

- ... and it's a very large matrix of numbers.
	- Weird.

---

### What about living creatures?

---

### Lots of animals communicate

- Mating calls

- Alert calls

- Territorial displays

---

### Mimicry

### Nim Chimpsky

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/nimchimpsky.jpg">

---

### Nim Chimpsky

- A chimpanzee raised in a human family to learn ASL by Herbert Terrace

- Learned 125 signs (maybe fewer)

- Combined signs to produce 2-4 word utterances

---

### Nim Chimpsky didn't seem to have full-on language

- Never got past 2-4 sign utterances

	- 'Nim Banana Me Eat'
	
- Only 7% of utterances served to advance the conversation

- 39% of utterances were repetitions of what had just been signed

- Entirely 'pragmatic' use of language

- Terrace argued that Nim never learned anything 

- There were some methodological... oddities

---

### Nim led a pretty sad life

- Became rather strong and violent, as male chimps do.

- Later given back to a research facility and used for medical research

- Still used signs (e.g. 'play', hug') from time to time

- Died at an animal rescue ranch of a heart attack

- Featured in the (sad) documentary [Project Nim](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1814836/)

### Brown-headed Cowbirds

- 'Brood Parasites'

	- Lay their eggs in other birds' nests

- How do they know that they're not the other birds?

- [Innately recognized 'passphrase' calls](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/220/13/2345)

	- 'AHA!  These are my people!'

### The Honeybee 'Waggle Dance'

---

### Bat Vocalizations

- According to [Prat et al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39419), bat vocalizations have detectable information about...

- The speaker

- Behavior context (e.g. feeding, mating, perching, sleep)

- The desired listener

---

### Prairie Dogs

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/prairiedog.jpg">

---

### Prairie Dog Language?

- [Dr. Con Slobodchikoff](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~cns3/) argues that prairie dogs have...

- Different calls for different species of predators

- Calls containing descriptive information about location, size, shape, color of predators

- Prairie dogs will alarm differently on the basis of your shirt

	- Yes, prairie dogs are judging your fit
	
- Some signs of new calls for shapes

- [A great video on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1kXCh496U0)

---

### But is it language?

- We've only seen one domain of 'language'

	- A rich vocabulary of various forms of 'Oh crap! Hide!'

- There's no sign of non-pragmatic language use

	- e.g. "Hey Herbie, remember all those grubs we ate last month?  Yeah, that was great"
	
- So, we'd need more data to call this 'Language'

	- ... and I need to see this work replicated!

---

### So, do non-human animals have Language?

- Nobody's truly doing human language yet

- There's evidence of complex information being encoded

- ... but we're still gonna need more evidence before it's 'Language'

---

### Quick note

- I expect this portion of the lecture to continue to change during my career
	- There are too many interesting studies coming out
	- I didn't expect language to emerge in LLMs, and then it did
	- ... and the move away from UG in the field will broaden some perspectives

- We don't necessarily understand the means by which animals communicate
	- An alien who doesn't see visible light or hear frequencies between 20Hz and 20kHz would think us telepaths
	
- At some level, western society is *very* interested in *not* discovering animal language	

- Doing so would trigger many uncomfortable conversations!

---

### So, we know what language is.

- We know it's a universal thing, although with variation

- And we know that animals don't seem to do it (yet?)

- Now, for the (potentially) scarier side of Language

---

### We think in language, regularly

- We use linguistic concepts in categorizing the world

- We discuss the world using our most available set of terms

- We lack terms for some more abstract feelings

- So, language is a part of our thinking process

- This leads many to ask...

---

## Does the language we speak determine how we think?

---

### The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

- Also known as 'Linguistic Relativity'

- 'The language you speak influences how you think about the world'

- This is fascinating and terrifying

---

### There are many possible forms

- **No effect**: 'The language we speak has *zero* effect on our thought or cognition'

- **Weak**: 'The language we speak has some effect on our thought and cognition'

- **Strong**: 'The language we speak guides our thought and cognition'

- **Determinism**: 'The language we speak *determines* our thought and cognition'

---

### The debate is now mostly about effect size and domain

- It's clear that there's *some* effect

	- [See Dr. Lera Boroditsky at UCSD make a great case](https://www.ted.com/talks/lera_boroditsky_how_language_shapes_the_way_we_think)
	
- But it's also clear that it's not deterministic

	- We can recognize and discuss objects, events, or colors which we don't have words for
	
- The debate is now focused on the size and nature of the effect

	- ... and whether/how much it *actually* matters in our lives
	
---

### This is an amazing area of research

- ... and it's one I wish we could spend more time on

---

## For next time...

- Watch [Dr. Boroditsky's TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/lera_boroditsky_how_language_shapes_the_way_we_think)

	- Not required, but worth your time

# What are languages?

---

### There are ~7,100 living languages in the world 

<small>[(Source)](https://www.ethnologue.com)</small>

---

### 23 languages are spoken by more than 50 million people

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/ethnologue_lgtable.jpg">

---

### Wow, that's amazing! 1.3 billion people all speak the same language!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/raisedfingermeme.jpg">
														  
---

### Language is a bit more complicated for Linguists!

---

### Remember that multilingualism is common!

- America is ridiculously monolingual compared to the rest of the world

- We talk about people having an "L1" (first acquired language(s)), "L2" (second acquired language), and so on

- Don't forget that many folks have more than one language, and they can blend!

---

### ... but let's focus on 'one language'

### What's this thing?

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/bubbler.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/bubbler_map.jpg">

---


### Not everybody from a region will have (all of) the dialect features

- This is as much a function of attitude as location

	- 'Rootedness' plays a major role (c.f. [Paul Reed's Work](http://paulereed.com/))

	- There are many aspects of a person's identity that add up to "dialect"

---

### There are many more regions and regional features we haven't covered

- Consider this a taste, not a meal!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="dialects/dialects_9.png">

---

### It's not that simple
- Young Speakers
- Old Speakers
- Men
- Women
- Non-Binary speakers
- Trans speakers
- Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Queer Speakers
- Speakers of AAVE
- Latinx/Chicano Speakers
- Educated Speakers
- Uneducated Speakers
- Urban Speakers
- Rural Speakers
- Nerds
- ... and so on forever

---

### These are Sociolects

- A sociolect is a dialect shared among members of a certain social group

- People can have influence from more than one sociolect at once

	- We often switch sociolects when in different social situations

	- Using a sociolect is a way of showing affiliation with a certain identity

- Some sociolects have prestige, others don’t

	- ... and which dialect is prestigious varies by context
    
- These are the bread and butter of sociolinguists

---

### People can switch among their dialects and sociolects

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/snowflake.jpg">

---

### Idiolect

- You use language in a certain way, that way is your “idiolect”

- Your esoteric pronunciations
- The expressions and catch phrases that you use and prefer
- The specific meanings that given words or phrases have to you
- The features which you’ve inherited from your region(s) or social group(s)

---

### More Idiolect Features

- Odd spellings or emojis you use (LOL vs. lol, “Thanx”)

- Your writing style, speech style
- Your individual set of speech organs (which may change the way your speech sounds)

## Language is fractal

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/fractal.jpg">

---

### Language is fractal

- You see larger patterns at first

- Then you look closer and find more patterns and structure

- Then you look closer and find more patterns and structure

- Then you look closer and find more patterns and structure

- Then you look closer and find more patterns and structure

- Then you look closer and find more patterns and structure

- ... you get the idea

---

### It's very hard to find clear lines

- It can be hard to define what is a single language

	- The distinction between 'language' and 'dialect' is often political

	- If you like them, they speak a dialect of your language, otherwise, whole different language

- Everybody speaks at least one dialect, sociolect, and idiolect

- People often have features from multiple dialects or sociolects or languages

- Each of these things overlap in complicated ways

- **There's a reason that the social elements of language have an entire subfield**

---

### We try to discuss variation in terms of languages, dialects, sociolects and idiolects

- Dialects are a particular form of language used by a certain social or geographical group of people

- A sociolect is a particular social group’s specific dialect

- Your idiolect is your unique way of using language and speaking

- Your speech and language is variable from situation to situation, from word to word

- As you look closer and closer at language, you find more patterns and complexity, not less

---

### "I can tell Pat really sent the text, they always use the 🤷‍ emoji".  This is an example of their...

A) Dialect

B) Sociolect

C) Idiolect

D) Emojiolect

### "I can tell Pat really sent the text, they always use the 🤷‍ emoji".  This is an example of their...

A) Dialect

B) Sociolect

C) <correct>Idiolect</correct>

D) Emojiolect

---

### Linguists are interested in how *everybody* talks

- Not just one prestigious or 'correct' variety

- Not just the 'academic' or 'mainstream' dialects

- Not just what goes in textbooks or dictionaries

- ... and as such ...

---

### We don't tend to believe in a 'correct variety' of a language

- It's hard to pin down which one *would be* correct

	- "Which region/dialect/sociolect/idiolect is right?"

- The situationally 'correct or 'appropriate' variety is about social context

	- "That variety is bad here" does not mean "That variety is bad"

- **'Correct' is a social judgement, not a linguistic one**

---

### So, we think about 'grammar' differently than your English professor

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/grammartime.jpg">

# Prescriptive and Descriptive Grammar

---

### Speakers of a language have intuitions about grammar

---

### Which of these sentences is 'grammatical' English?

A) "John went with Tina to the cat show"

B) "The boy flame take watchingsly"

C) "Correct Horse Battery Staple"

D) "Esta oración no es inglés"

E) I'm not sure which is grammatical

<section class="clicker"></section>

---

### Descriptive Grammar

The grammatical rules of the language, dialect, and sociolect being spoken which *describe* how (a group of) people *actually talk or write*.

---

### "The boy flame take watchingsly" is descriptively ungrammatical

- 'Grammatical' sentences are in harmony with the local rules

- People 'stumble' over ungrammatical sentences

- **When something is descriptively ungrammatical, it's often hard to understand**

	- Although not all hard-to-understand sentences are ungrammatical!

---
### Symbol Usage Note

Linguists mark ungrammatical sentences with a star, questionable ones with a ?

- *The boy flame take watchingsly

- ?Which friends has Thomas painted a picture of them?

---

### Dialects and Sociolects and Idiolects each have their own descriptive grammar!

- ... and they follow it!

---

### Black English

- Also known as 'AAVE' (African American Vernacular English) or historically,  'Ebonics'

- Negative Concord

	- Can't nobody say he don't work
	- *Nobody can say he doesn't work.

- Habitual be
	- He be drivin all over the place
	- *He often drives all over the place lately

- Copula deletion
	- She mean.
	- *She's mean
    
- **These grammatical rules are followed carefully by speakers of AAVE**
    
---

### It is patently false to claim that Black (or Chicano, Southern, etc) speakers 'have no grammar'

- Damnit.

- They use the grammar of their dialect as carefully as you do yours!

---

Let's try a different set of grammar judgements...

---

### Which of these sentences is 'grammatical' English?

A) 'I never know what I should write with'

B) 'I don't know who she photographed'

C) 'Ron and Jerry stayed home last night'

D) 'We hope to considerably advance machine learning technology'

E) I'm not sure which is grammatical

<section class="clicker"></section>

---

### According to some people, C is only the correct answer

A) 'I never know what I should write with'

B) 'I don't know who she photographed'

C) <correct>'Ron and Jerry stayed home last night'</correct>

D) 'We hope to considerably advance machine learning technology'

E) I'm not sure which is grammatical

- **A B and D all violated rules of prescriptive grammar**

---

### Prescriptive Grammar

Made up or social rules that *prescribe* how people *should* talk or write

---

### The 'rules' being violated

- A)  'I never know what I should write with'

	- "Never end a sentence with a preposition"

- B) 'I don't know who she photographed'

	- "'whom' should be used for a direct object"

- D) 'We hope to stunningly advance machine learning technology'

	- "How dare you split an infinitive, you ingrate!"

---

### Which one of these clicker questions was harder?

---

### Prescriptive grammar rules are social rules

- They are not universally observed

- They do not generally affect your ability to be understood

- They're often based in written ambiguity (e.g. there, they're, their)

- They're often quoted from one particular source (Strunk and White, 🤣)

- They're often associated with a specific setting or institution

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/grammar_nazis.jpg">

---

### What other prescriptive grammar rules are you familiar with?

---

### Let's work on that distinction a bit more

---

### Which of these rules is a *descriptive* grammar rule?

A) "Say 'I'll make do', not 'I'll make due'"

B) "All sentences must include a verb"

C) "Always include the punctuation inside the quote"

D) "In-text citations should be surrounded by parentheses"

E) "Emojis cannot be used in professional correspondence"

<section class="clicker"></section>

---

### Which of these rules is a *descriptive* grammar rule?

A) "Say 'I'll make do', not 'I'll make due'"

B) <correct>"All sentences must include a verb"</correct>

C) "Always include the punctuation inside the quote".

D) "In-text citations should be surrounded by parentheses"

E) "Emojis cannot be used in professional correspondence"

---

### Which of these sentences is a *descriptively* ungrammatical?

A) "Me and Mark are going clubbing"

B) "I hate polar bears, there paws are too big."

C) "Frank Suzanne live Dallas"

D) "Herbert ain't gone to the store yet"

E) "Michael Bay luvs 2 desecrate good cartoonz."

<section class="clicker"></section>

### Which of these sentences is a *descriptively* ungrammatical?

A) "Me and Mark are going clubbing"

B) "I hate polar bears, there paws are too big."

C) <correct>"Frank Suzanne live Dallas"</correct>

D) "Herbert ain't gone to the store yet"

E) "Michael Bay luvs 2 desecrate good cartoonz. "

---

### Linguists are interested in *descriptive grammar*

- We don't believe there is a 'correct' variety

- A rule which a large number of people don't follow isn't a real rule

	- ... or it's not a rule in all dialects
    
- And if you speak a non-standard variety, we think that's awesome!

---

### It's fun to see *when* prescriptive corrections are made

- Sometimes, people truly believe the rules are real

	- Awwwwwww....
    
- Often, they're trying to help

	- "If you want to be taken seriously in [context], you'll need to talk like this"
    
- Sometimes, they're trying to show superiority

	- "You bring an argument before me yet you cannot master even basic grammatical structure!  Fool!"
    
- ... and frustratingly often, it's because ...

---

### Attacking people's language is often used as a covert way of attacking people

- "Somebody needs to teach these inner-city kids to be more articulate"

- "You're in America, learn to speak English right"

- "You're so shrill, you should be more lady-like in your speech"

- "He's a nice boy, but why does he have to talk so Mexican?"

- ["Damned teenage girls filling their speech with [insert thing we all do]"](https://www.npr.org/2015/07/23/425608745/from-upspeak-to-vocal-fry-are-we-policing-young-womens-voices)

---

### Whole languages get similar ideological treatments

- People love describing languages as 'rough' or 'unevolved' or 'angry' or 'primitive' or 'romantic' (and so on)

	- These ideas are generally not supported by or evaluable in linguistic theory!

- They often cite characteristics found in huge numbers of languages as 'evidence' of this

- These are usually social judgements applied to people via their languages

	- ... rather than facts about the languages themselves

- Be careful with these kinds of language ideologies, as they can be hurtful

	- ... and ask yourself why and how they're being discussed!

---


### Of course, it's not all like that

- Most people mean well

- There's value to learning how to talk like the Old People with Power want you to talk in some contexts

	- "Code switching" among dialects for fun and profit.
	
- ... but it's important to think carefully about these things

---

### This is why Linguists don't like being called 'grammarians'

- It's why we spend so much time talking about the difference between descriptive and prescriptive grammar in LIGN 101

- ... and it's why we'll spend the rest of the quarter talking about descriptive grammar, rather than prescriptive grammar

---

# Wrapping up

- Language is fractal with massive amounts of variation

	- We try to subdivide variation into dialects, sociolects, and idiolects

- It's hard to identify a 'correct' variety, and that's a social thing anyways

- Descriptive rules describe what's actually being said

- Prescriptive rules prescribe what somebody *thinks* should be said

- Linguists care about descriptive grammar, and don't tend to buy into 'prescriptive rules'

---

## For next time

- Read Fromkin's chapter on 'Phonetics' if you'd like

- ... and don't be a pedantic twit

# Phonetics: The Sounds of Language

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---
			  
### Today's Plan

- How does speech work?

- How can we write down speech?

- How do we describe consonants?

- How do we describe vowels?

---

## How does speech work?

---

### The Speech Process

* Flapping bits of meat inside your head while blowing out air

* This creates vibrations in the air you're expelling

* The ear picks these up, and inteprets them as speech.

* This process is studied in **Phonetics**

---

### The Lungs

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/lungs.jpg">

---

### Flapping bits of meat ("articulation")

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/nasalsagittal.jpg"> 

---

### Simplified a bit...

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sagittal_simple.jpg">

---

### You will not be responsible for any anatomical terms not required for transcription on exams
	
---

### The Tongue

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/tonguefromside.jpg">

<video class="wide" controls src="video/mri_joynash.mp4"></video>

---

<video class="wide" controls src="video/mri_deck_the_halls.mp4"></video>

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/ohgodwhy.jpg">


---

### Let's do an experiment

---

> The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak.

---

### Speech is absolutely insane

- It's a series of fluid and overlapping gestures

- It's amazingly complex

- ... and it's nothing like we think it is

---

### How do we wrap our heads around it?

- First, we break speech into 'segments' or 'phones'

- Then, we figure out how to describe those phones and their properties

- This lets us *transcribe* what was said, rather than what words were said

- But first you need to realize that...

---

## Your writing system is a trainwreck

- <img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/trainwreck.png">

---

### Your writing system is lying to you

- Every minute of every day

	- "They thoroughly and roughly wrought the boughs in the borough, through and through"
	
	- C doesn't exist
	
	- The 'ee' in 'pee' is silent
	
	- The 'e'
	
	- TH is neither a t nor an h, and represents two different sounds

- ... and if you start thinking about letters, you're going to start struggling

- For this class, consider your writing system with the same skepticism you would normally reserve for a guy with a broken bottle walking towards you in a dark alley.

---

### ... but wait, speech is super complicated

- Our writing system is lying to us

- Many languages don't have writing systems

- ... and we still need to write down what was said in them

- ## Is there no hope?!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/surprised_owls.jpg">

<audio data-autoplay src="humorimg/dramatic.wav"></audio>

---

(Nah, it's cool, we've got the IPA!)

---

### The International Phonetic Alphabet

- A system for *transcribing* what was said, that's based on *describing* individual phones

- We'll discuss a reduced set of the IPA focusing on the English language in this class

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/ipa_chart.jpg">

---

### The International Phonetic Alphabet

 - A system for *transcribing* what was said, that's based on *describing* individual phones

 - The IPA should be able to transcribe speech in *any* human language or dialect

---
	
### The IPA allows us to 'transcribe' speech

- You throw away the writing system, and write down the *sequence of sounds* being produced

- "Black Lives Matter"

- In Will's dialect: /blæk lajvz mæɾəɹ/

	- Note the /z/, and the /ɾ/ tap, and the lack of "c"

---
	
### The Entire IPA is shown on the IPA chart
	
	<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/ipa_chart.jpg">

---

## Important Note: Most Online IPA Charts with Sound are awful!

- ipachart.com is bad and should feel bad

- <https://savethevowels.org/ipa> is not

- [Here's the International Phonetic Association's Version](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/IPAcharts/inter_chart_2018/IPA_2018.html)
	
- If you're just typing IPA, you can use [this tool](https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/intipa/#/keyboard)
	
- Use the quick reference guide too!

---

### We have a new tool!

## <http://savethevowels.org/ipa>

- Give this a try to see audio and video of IPA sounds!

---

### To understand the IPA, you need to understand how sounds work
	
---

## How do we describe how speech sounds are made?

---

### We break the world into two kinds of speech sounds

- **Consonants:** Constrict, obstruct, or divert air in the vocal tract when being produced

- **Vowels:** Shape the (unobstructed) vocal tract to change the sound emitted

---

## Describing Consonants

---
### Three steps to describing Consonants

* We need to know three things:

* **Place**: Where is the sound made?

* **Manner**: What are we doing there?

* **Voicing**: Are we making voicing?

---

## Place

---

### Place of Articulation

- Where is the sound being made?

---
### Place

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sagittal_flesh.jpg"> 

---

### Place

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sagittal_labeled.png"> 

---

### Place

* **Bilabial**: As in "***b***oy"

* **Labiodental**: As in "***V***ote"

* **Interdental**: As in "***Th***ose"

* **Alveolar**: As in "***T***o***t***e***s***!"

	- Your alveolars may be *dental*

* **Postalveolar**: As in "***J***u***dge***"
	- Your textbook calls these 'palatal'
	- We'll accept either for this class

* **Velar**: As in "**C**lam**k**i**ng**

* **Glottal**: As in "Uh***-***oh!"	
	
---
	
<section class="clicker"></section>

### The first and last sounds in "King" are...

A) **Bilabial**: As in "***B***at***m***an isn't ***m***e!"

B) **Labiodental**: As in "***V***owels aren't ***f***oul!"

C) **Alveolar**: As in "***T***o***t***e***s*** ***l***i***t***!"

D) **Postalveolar**: As in "***J***u***dgy*** ***Ch***eetahs"

E) **Velar**: As in "**G**o **c**all you**ng** **c**arpenters"

E) <correct>**Velar**: As in "**G**o **c**all you**ng** **c**arpenters"</correct>

---
	
### There are other places English doesn't use

- 'Uvular' sounds are made involving the uvula

	- As Cardi B says, 'that little dangly thang that swang in the back of my throat'

	- The French "r" sound in 'rouge'

- 'Retroflex' sounds curl the tongue up and back

	- Present in Hindi/Urdu, as well as many other languages!

## Manner of Articulation

---

### Manner

"So what are you doing with the articulators?"

---

### Manner

* **Stops**: Stop the airflow (also called 'plosives')
	- As in '**c**a**t** **d**o**ck**e**t**'

* ***Taps***: Throw your tongue against the roof of your mouth
	- As in 'la**t**er la**dd**er wi**nn**ers'

* **Fricatives**: Constrict the airflow to make sounds

	- As in '**f**la**sh**y **s**o**v**iet **sh**i**f**ter**s**'

* **Nasals**: Channel the air out the nose

	- As in 'wi**ng** **m**a**n** '

---

### Three steps to describing Consonants

* We need to know three things:

* **Place**: Where is the sound made?

* **Manner**: What are we doing there?

* **Voicing**: Are we making voicing?

---

### All consonants can be described this way

- /m/ - Voiced Bilabial Nasal

- /t/ - Voiceless Alveolar Stop

- /g/ - Voiced Velar Stop

- /f/ - Voiceless Labiodental Fricative

---

### There are a couple of weird ones

- /ɹ/ - The English "R", a voiced 'alveolar' approximant
	- "Reed read the wrong resolution"
	- Super weird

- /w/ - A voiced labio-velar approximant
	- "Will would wisely watch the wind"
	- Has a voiceless version ("Cool whip" from Family Guy)

---
			  
### 'Affricates'

If you combine a fricative and a stop, you get an affricate

- **J**u**dg**e (d͡ʒʌd͡ʒ)

- **Ch**eese (t͡ʃiz)

- Ca**ts** (kæts)

---

Once we've organized sounds by place, manner, and voicing, we have...

---

### English Consonants

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/ipa_conschart_reading.jpg">

---
<img  class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/ipa_consonants.jpg"> 

---

### Can't figure out where in the mouth that is?

Ask [Sammy the Interactive Sagittal Section](http://smu-facweb.smu.ca/~s0949176/sammy/)!

- Or check UBC's [Enunciate](https://enunciate.arts.ubc.ca/) site

---

### So, that's consonants.

---

## Vowels!

---

### Vowels are created by shaping your vocal tract

* A vowel is voicing passing through (and resonating in) an unobstructed vocal tract!

* If we change the position of the tongue, we change the resonances

---


<img  class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/voweltongue.png"> 

---

### Vowels are different from consonants

- They're always* voiced

- They can (and do) occur on their own. I.

- We describe vowels using different characteristics

---

### How many vowels are present in Mainstream US English?

A) 5

B) 5, sometimes 6

C) 12

D) 17

E) 21

### / i, ɪ, ɛ, æ, ə, əɹ, ʌ, ɑ, ɔ, ʊ, u /

- beet
- bit
- bet
- bat
- sof**a**
- bird
- but
- bot
- bought
- book
- boot

---

/i/ - beet, see, seen, sear, seal

/ɪ/ - bit, sit, tin, sill

/ɛ/ - bet, set, sent, fair, sell

/æ/ - bat, sat, pant, pal

/ʌ/ - but, sun, pun, lull (ə in sofa, amount)

/əɹ/ - bird, purr, earl, butter, clamor (this is often broken into two vowels!)

/ɑ/ - bot, saw, star, paul, pawn, (cot*)

/ɔ/ - corn /kɔɹn/, boy /bɔj/ (caught*)

/ʊ/ - book, hood, puss

/u/ - boot, who’d, loose, lure, loon

---


### Do you produce 'Cot' and 'Caught' differently?

A) Yes, they're two different vowels

B) No, they're the same vowel
	
<section class="clicker"></section>

---

### A note on /ɔ/ vs. /ɑ/

- These are two vowels for some people
  - Cot (/ɑ/) vs. caught (/ɔ/)
  
- For many speakers, these have merged in all but a few cases
  - I am one of these speakers

- Even for me, “horse” and “corn” still have /ɔ/.  (/hɔɹs/ and /kɔɹn/)
  - Also, “boy” /bɔj/

---

### What's the difference between /ʌ/ and /ə/?

- They sound the same, but we use /ə/ in *unstressed* positions in words

- If there's just one vowel in the word, and it sounds like 'uh', it's /ʌ/

- This is the same difference between /ɜ˞/ and /əɹ/ (although for this class, you can write /əɹ/ for both)

- More details [at this link](http://wstyler.ucsd.edu/posts/difference_schwa_wedge.html)

---

### Describing Vowels

- For vowels, we talk about three additional dimensions

- 1- Where is the tongue in terms of height?
  - (High, Low, or Mid)
  - Also "Closed, Open, or Mid"

- 2- Where is the tongue in terms of horizontal space?
  - (Front, Central, or Back)

- 3- Are your lips rounded or not?

---
<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/ipa_vowels_with_tongue.jpg">
---

### Diphthongs

- Vowels where the tongue moves through the mouth

- Start at one vowel, move to another vowel

- Things like “boy” (/ɔj/), “buy” (/aj/), “bay” (/ej/), “boat” (/ow/), “cow” (/aw/)

- Others are monophthongs

---

### MUSE Diphthongs

/ɔj/ - boy, soy, toy, join, oil, Roy

/aj/ - buy, right, try, sigh, die, fire

/ej/ - play, bay, may, ray, lay, trail

/ow/ - boat, oat, wrote, pope, toll

/aw/ - how, now, brown, cow, prow, louse

---

### So, Mainstream US English has lots of vowels

- 12 Monophthongs

	- / i, ɪ, ɛ, æ, ə, əɹ, ʌ, ɑ, ɔ, ʊ, u /

- 5 Diphthongs

	- /ɔj, aj, ej, ow, aw/

- And we describe these vowels in terms of high-to-low, front-to-back, and rounded or not. 

---

### So, that's how we describe consonants and vowels

---

### Wrapping it up

- Speech is crazy complicated

- The English writing system is a large lagoon of lies

- We describe consonants by talking about place, manner, and voicing

- The English writing system is a festival of falsehoods
			  
- We describe vowels by talking about height, front-back, and rounding

- The English writing system is a dumpster of deception

- The IPA can save us!

# Phonetics: The Sounds of Language (are awesome)

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---
              
### Today's Plan

- More on IPA Transcription

- Why are we learning some IPA, anyways?

- Some phonetic phun

---

### Now that we understand how speech sounds are produced...

- We can identify the proper symbols in the IPA

- We can start to transcribe speech using the IPA

---

### Online Audio IPA Charts are a useful resource

- <http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/>

- We also have videos at <https://savethevowels.org/ipa>

- **Make sure the sounds you're using are on your quick reference sheet!**

- As is memorizing some words for each symbol and then process-of-eliminating

	- "Hmm, it's not the vowel in 'snack' or 'but' or 'boat', but it does "

- “ng” is usually /ŋ/, as in “ring” /ɹɪŋ/

- “th” can be /θ/ or /ð/

- “x” is usually /ks/, as in axis /æksɪs/

- English does not allow double ('geminate') consonants

	- “soccer” is /sɑkəɹ/, crass is /kɹæs/

---

### Do not capitalize when making IPA transcriptions!

 - Capital and small-caps letters in the IPA mean different things!

---

### More lies

Sliced - /slaɪst/

- Buzzed - /bʌzd/

- Close (near) - /klows/

- Close (a door) - /klowz/

---

### Silent letters aren't real

- “k” in “knee”
- “b” in “lamb"
- “e” in name, I will cry.

---

### English writing is often ambiguous

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/tap_am_i_a_joke.jpg">

---

### Sometimes, consonants take over

- Words like 'cotton' or 'people' or 'bull' can have a final consonant which feels 'alone'

	- There doesn't seem to be a vowel there

- We refer to these as 'syllabic consonants'

- You can use /ən əl/ to represent that, or the IPA 'syllabic' diacritic (l̩ or n̩)

	- So 'cotton people bull' = /kɑʔən pipəl bəl/ or /kɑʔn̩ pipl̩ bl̩/

	- Note that for many, 'bull' is still /bʊl/

---

### You'll want to use the tie bar for affricates

- It's good habit to write /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡ʒ/ with the tie bar when they're affricates 

	- Rather than a sequence of two different sounds (e.g. "hotshot /hɑtʃɑt/")

- It's less critical for English, but it's good practice

---

### There is no I in team

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/noiinteam.jpg">

---

### Words don't have one IPA 'equivalent'

- You're always transcribing somebody else saying them

- There is no such thing as an automatic IPA “translator”, and there never could be

	- ChatGPT is mid at this too

- Some dictionaries give you IPA, but badly 

- ... and we can totally tell if you used that

---

### Some symbols don't mean what they do in English

- /y/ : High front rounded vowel

- /j/: Voiced palatal approximant (as in 'Yes')

- /r/: Voiced alveolar trill (the Spanish 'rolled R')

- /ɹ/: English 'r' sound (as in 'red')

---

... by this point, you're likely wondering...

- ### Why the heck are we learning about the IPA!?!

---

### The boring answers

- It makes you think about how you talk *and* what you're saying

- It prepares you for future linguistics classes which will use it

- You can work for an airport announcing names!

---

### 1) Because your writing system probably sucks

- “They thoroughly and roughly wrought the boughs in the borough, through and through”

- /ðej θəɹəli n̩ ɹʌfli ɹɑt ðə bɑwz ɪn ðə bəɹow θɹu n̩ θɹu/

---

### 2) Because it’s useful to be able to write things down, even when you don’t know the word(s)

- (/r:!ʛma/)

---

### 3) Because you don’t always have a writing system to use.

- Seriously, many languages don't have one

---

### 4) To train your brain to hear differences more easily

- /θ/ or /ð/

---

### 5) To capture individual variations in speech

- Is it “sick”, or /ɬɪk/?

---

### 6) To capture dialect differences in speech

---

### RP (British English) vs. Mainstream US English

- /əˈlumɪnəm/ vs. /aljuˈmɪnium/

- /ɡəˈɹɑʒ/ vs. /ˈɡɛɹɑʒ/

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/sellyouriron.jpg">

- "Sell your iron to Walter Zion"

- /sɛl jəɹ ajəɹn tə wɑltəɹ zajən/

### Oh, Boston

- park the car in harvard yard

- /pɑɹk ðə kɑɹ ɪn hɑɹvəɹd jɑɹd/

- /pɑ:k ðə kɑ: ɪn hɑvəd jɑ:d/

### There's one misconception I want to address

---

## "People in Africa speak only with clicks"

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/false.jpg"> 

---

### Clicks in Africa

* Clicks are used extensively in Khoisan languages 

	* (spoken by ~400,000 people)
	
* They've also been borrowed into Zulu and Xhosa, both Bantu languages (within Niger-congo)

	* (~17.6 million speakers)
	
* This means that only ~1% of Africans speak a language where there are clicks

* All of these languages have lots of non-click sounds!

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/omg.jpg"> 

---

## "I could never do that!"

* Yes, you can.

---

# Anybody can pronounce any language!

---

### Speech organs are universal

* There is not a meaningful difference between your vocal tract and a San speaker's

	- [Small differences may exist](https://doi.org/10.1093/jole/lzx004), but the effect size is small

* The only meaningful difference between humans is practice!

* It's easier if you learn the language at a younger age

* There are no sounds English speakers "just can't produce", *with practice*.

---

### ... but that doesn't mean it's easy

* Make a Voiceless Velar Fricative /x/ (as in "Chanukkah", "Challah", "Bach")

* Make a voiced alveolar trill /r/ (the Spanish Rolled R)

* Make a voiceless palatal fricative (ç) (as in an angry cat)

* Make a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative (ɬ) (as in "nahuatl")

* Make a /!/ click between two vowels (/a!a/)

---

### IPA Conclusion

- The IPA is a great resource

- Do the interactive tutorial for HW1 to learn more about how it works

- Remember, you're writing down *what was actually said*, and your writing system doesn't help with that!

---

### It's always hard to figure out what to include in a LIGN 101

- Today, I have abandoned good sense and tradition in favor of my own burning passions

- ***"Screw it, I'm talking about speech perception!"***

---

# Speech Perception is impossibly hard

---

Speech is flapping bits of meat around in your head and throat while you expel air.

* **Speech perception is turning the resulting vibrations in the air back into language**

---

### So, what do these vibrations look like?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sky.png">

### How do humans pick them up?

### "Oh, he's talking about that thing up there!"

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/skyphoto.jpg">

---

"Wait.  You can't do that.  You skipped a step.  Go back."

* **That step takes years of grad school to understand how little we understand.**

---

## We're going to ignore the "how" and focus on the "wow!"

---

## Let's do some speech perception magic tricks!

---

## Trick #1: So close, yet so far

---

### You're so used to understanding English that you've gotten lazy!

* You consistently hear word boundaries

* You can pick out missing words from context

* You know roughly what to expect

* **Let's take you out of your comfort zones!**

### Trick #7: Hearing Tongues

---
	
### We may be hearing tongues
	
- We may be taking acoustics and processing it to build a model of the world
	
- Then using that model to understand what's happening in the other person's head
	
- Which then tells you the phones being produced
	
	- ... and lets you reconstruct words

### This is a woman you've never met, and will likely never meet

* She's 28 years old from Monrovia, Liberia

* She also speaks Liberian Pidgin English

* You've never seen her face, never conducted a conversation

* ... **and you still understood her.**

---

### I mean, seriously...

* You've probably never heard anybody with a Liberian Pidgin English accent

* You've probably never even heard anybody from Liberia

* You had no way of seeing her to judge how large or small her vocal tract was

* You couldn't rely on gestures or facial movements to help fill in blanks.

* You had no context to know which words she would or wouldn't say

* *This is a worst-case scenario for speech perception*

* **... but you all didn't care!**

---

### We don't seem to care that...

* Every person sounds different

	* Sometimes due to language background or social status

	* Sometimes due to differences in anatomy

* My vowel in "bet" might be acoustically the same as yours in "bit"

* No two productions of the same word by the same person are identical

* ... and in fact...

---

### You are your own unique little acoustical snowflake

* **"... but... uh... we're doing it right now."**

---

## OK, OK.  You got me.

---

# Speech is impossibly hard, but we do it anyways

---

... but that's only because we're *really* awesome.

---

### Our ability to produce speech is *incredible*

* We flap bits of meat around in our heads,

* in precise, intricate patterns and series,

* without thinking, "trying", or running out of air,

* while walking, running, biking, or eating,

* ...and still get the message across.

---

### Our ability to perceive speech is *incredible*

* We're able to pull signals out of the air,

* parse them according to the rules in our minds,

* take advantage of tiny details,

* recover *huge* amounts of lost information,

* and wade through mind-boggling variability

* ... all without even noticing you're doing anything special.

---

### Signed language phonetics is just as amazing!

- Different modality, but similar sets of problems!

---

### Producing and understanding words is the most complicated thing you will *ever* do

* ... and you don't even think twice about it.

# Phonology: The Sound Patterns of Language

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---

### Today's Plan

- What is phonology?

- Phonemic Analysis from three different perspectives

- How to tell if your instructor is actually Batman

- Writing phonological rules

---

### First, a note on notation

- We're going to start differentiating words in IPA between // and [ ]

- /tap/ means 'top' at an abstract level.

- [tap] means that sequence of sounds at a surface level.

- /tap/ exists in the speaker's mind, [tap] exits a person's mouth

- More later...

---

### So, now we know roughly what speech is like

- What sounds we're using in English

- How to describe them

- ... and some symbols we can use to talk about sounds, not letters

---

### ... so, we should just be able to put the sounds together and we’re good, right?

---

### /ɪ/ /k/ /p/ /s/ /d/

- [skɪp]
- [kɪd]
- [pɪk]
- [sɪp]
- [dɪp]
- [kɪs]

---

### ... but wait

- *[ɪ]
- *[k]
- *[pɪ]
- *[pdɪ]
- *[kpsdɪdspk]

---

### /s/ is the plural marker in English, right?

- [skɪps]

- [pɪks]

- but...

- *[kɪds]

	- Should be [kɪdz]
	
- *[kɪss]
	
	- Should be [kɪsɪz]
---

### Wait.  So clearly the plural marker is more than just 'add an s'

- There are several versions, or "allomorphs", of the plural marking chunk (the 'morpheme')

- Is this just a memorized pattern?

- **What would /s/ become for new words?**

---

### The Wug Test

- Developed by Jean Berko Gleason

B) [wʌgz]

### How do we know this?!

- ... and why are there three different versions of the plural marker in English?!

---

# Phonology

---


### Phonology

Phonology is the study of how sounds pattern in Language and languages

---

## What do phonologists study?

---

### Within-Language Phonological Questions

- What sounds differentiate words? (Phonemic Analysis)
	- ... and what do speakers hear as being “the same sound”?
  
- How do speakers tend to group sounds together? (Natural Classes)

- What combinations are “legal” or preferred in the language? (Phonotactics)

- How are syllables formed and what kinds are legal? (Syllable Structure)

- How do we assign stress, pitch, and emphasis? (Metrical Phonology)

- *How can we generate a theory that explains all of that?*

---

### Theoretical Linguistics

- In theoretical linguistics, we have three big questions:

	- "How can we model human language and grammar?"
	
	- "Do these models describe what humans are doing in real language?"
	
	- "Are these models cognitively real?"

---

### How do we model the patterns we see in language?

- Can we describe the patterns we're seeing through some linguistic analysis or abstraction?

---

### Sample models for Wug-taming
		
- Are we choosing a form among many which does the fewest things we don't like?

	- "Do we just hate [gs] and [ʃs] clusters and avoid them by replacing them with something else?"
		
- Are we just remembering the words we've heard said before, and doing the rest from analogy?

	- "Are you finding a form for /wʌg+s/ by thinking about /mʌg+s/?"
	
- Are we using rules that transform 'underlying' sounds into one another?

	- "Does some process change /s/ into [z] or [ɪz]?"
	
	- **We're going to take this approach in this class!**
			
---

### How do these various approaches handle *real data from real languages*?

- Do they **predict all the things** that really happen?
	
- Do they **avoid predicting crazy things** that *never* happen?

- How do they **account for exceptions** and other weird data?

- Do they work for **all languages**, or just a subset?

---

### Are these models cognitively real?

- Could they be naturally learned and acquired by humans?

- Do they depend on assumptions that some information is *innate*?
	
- Does this theory describe what's *actually happening* inside the human mind?

- ... or is it just a tool for describing how languages work, which doesn't claim to be how *humans* make the choices?

---

### We're going to just scrape the surface of theoretical questions

- ... but know that they're there, and they're *really* interesting.

---

### Phonology is not the same thing as phonetics

- Phoneticians are more concerned with the physical processes of speech

	- Articulation, Perception, and the cognitive processes underlying both

- Phonologists are more concerned with the patterns of sound structure in different languages

	- Markedness, phonotactics, rules, and cross-linguistic patterns

---

### You can learn about one by studying the other

- ... and phonetic laboratory methods for studying phonological problems is a booming world

- Phonetics 💕 Phonology

---

### ... but they are deeply different fields

- Phonologists and phoneticians ask different questions

- We respect each other, and often hang out, but we're not doing the same thing

---

### Now, you collect data, write a grammar, and write a dictionary

- What are the meaningful chunks of words ('morphemes') in this language?

- What are the words in this language?

- How should this language be written?

- Decisions will need to be made

---

### One of the key questions you'll face is 'which sounds matter to speakers'

- Which sounds carry a *contrast*

- Which sounds *define words*

- Which sounds *cannot be changed without changing meanings*

---

### Phonemic Analysis

- Determining which sound changes *affect the meaning* of a word in a language

	- Phonemic Sounds

- ... which sound changes are *predictable*, and don't change word meanings

	- Allophonic Sounds

- ... and which sound variations are completely unpredictable and meaningless

	- Free variation
	
---

### We're going to look at this process using three different perspectives

- 1: By looking at data

- 2: By looking at perception

- 3: By looking at distributions

---

### This is a "threshold concept"

- That's why I'm covering it from three directions

- If you're struggling here, come to office hours

- It's normal and natural to struggle here

---

## Phonemic Analysis I: Let's use some data!

---

### "Oh no. There are sounds everywhere!"

- "People use a huge set of sounds, and I don't know which differences matter!"

- "What changes in sounds are *random*, and don't affect the meanings?"

- "What changes in sounds are *meaningful*, and change the meaning of a word?"

- "What changes in sounds can be *predicted* based on the other elements of the word, and don't change the meaning?"

- "What should I write down in my grammar or dictionary?"

---

### Does the difference between [t] and [t̪] change the meaning?

</center>

---

### It doesn't change the meaning and there's no pattern

- In English, it doesn't matter whether a /t/ is made as a dental sound [t̪] or an alveolar sound [t]

- Speakers can do two things and nobody particularly cares

- There's no pattern, no standard, just maddening chaos

- This is **free variation**.

### Does the difference between [k] and [p] change the meaning?

### The meaning is changed, and there's no pattern

- When you change from /k/ to /p/, the meaning of the word changes

	- ... but we can't predict which will show up except by knowing the word we want

- We see 'minimal pairs' (e.g. /ki/ and /pi/) where that segment is the only thing that's changed.

- /k/ and /p/ are in a **contrastive** distribution

- They represent **two different phonemes**

### It doesn't change the meaning, but we can predict when it happens!

- Changing from a short to long [ej] doesn't change the meaning for speakers

- Vowel length is *predictable* based on the voicing of the next consonant

- Short and long vowels are in a **complementary** distribution

- They are **allophones of the same phoneme**

## Phonemic Analysis II: Let's think about perception

---

### Spanish speakers hear...

- # "Cabo"

- When somebody says either

- # [kabo] or [kaβo]
	
---
	
### Spanish speakers hear...

- # /b/

- When somebody says either

- # [b] or [β]

---

### English has two /l/ sounds

- Light l ([l] as in 'lip')

- 'Dark' or Velarized l ([ɫ] as in 'pill')

- The 'Dark' L happens at the end of a syllable

---

### English speakers hear...

- # "Pill"

- When somebody says either...

- # [pɪl] or [pɪɫ]
	
---

### English speakers hear...

- # /l/

- When somebody says either...

- # [l] or [ɫ]
	
---

### Speakers of language hear...

- # The phoneme

- When somebody says...

- # Any of the allophones of that phoneme

---

### Phonemes are groups of sounds which trade places predictably!

- ... and that trading is opaque to speakers

- The /l/ phoneme has two allophones in English: [l] and [ɫ]

	- As in 'lip' and 'pill'

- The /t/ phoneme has many allophones in English: [t], [tʰ], [ʔ], [t˺], [ɾ], [ɾ̃]

	- As in 'stop', 'top', 'button', 'cat', 'later', 'winter'

- Every sound produced is an allophone of some phoneme

	 - ... but not every phoneme has multiple allophones

## Phonemic Analysis III: Looking at distributions

---

### Allophones are *predictable*

- They always show up in specific environments, and don't affect the meaning of the word

- [ɱ] shows up in English *only* when there's an /m/ before an /f/

	- 'Same' [sejm] but 'Symphony' [sɪɱfəni]

- [n̪] shows up in English *only* when there's an /n/ before an Interdental sound

	- 'Pine' [pajn] but 'Pine thug' [pajn̪ θʌɡ]

- [ɫ] shows up in MUSE *only* at the end of a syllable

- 'lip' [lɪp] but 'pill' [pɪɫ]

---

### Allophones show up according to rules
	
- If a sound is *variant* that only shows up according to a *rule*, it's an allophone of another phoneme

---

### Phonemes are *unpredictable*

- There is no pattern which dictates where they show up

- They can occur in the same environments

- They form 'minimal pairs', different words which differ only in that sound

	- (or sometimes near minimal pairs e.g., te[ð]er vs. mea[ʒ]ure)

---

### If a sound has its own identity in the language’s structure, it’s a phoneme.

- If it’s just another 'persona', it’s an allophone

---

### To determine this, consider a simple question...

---

## Is Will Batman?

- ![](people/will_batman_broken.jpg)

---

### How do you find out if your instructor is secretly Batman?

- You look at the distributions!

---

### If you see Batman and Will in the same context, they’re two different people.

- Finding two people talking to each other in the same place is a good indication that they're independent entities

- Two different personas can't be in the same place at the same time!

- They're in **contrastive** distribution

	- They happen in the same contexts

- If two sounds show up in an identical context, *they're independent phonemes*

---

### If you only see Will when there's no crime, and only see Batman where there's crime...

- This is a potential sign that Will *could be* the same being as Batman

- If Will runs into the bathroom when crime happens and Batman emerges, that's pretty good evidence

	- We call this an "alternation"

- They're in **complementary** distribution

	- One shows up in one context, the other in another context

- *If two sounds only show up in different contexts, or a sound suddenly changes, they're probably allophones of one phoneme*

---

### Complementary Distributions

(Batman and his alter-ego, Bruce Wayne)

![](img/batman.jpg)![](img/brucewayne.jpg)


---

### Contrastive Distribution

(Batman and Superman, two different heroes)
![](img/batmansuperman.jpg)

---

### So, to sum up the pop culture references...

- Batman and Bruce Wayne are really just one being

	- Bruce shows up in some circumstances, Batman in others
	
- [ej] and [ej:] are just one sound /ej/ in English phonology

	- [ej] shows up in some places, [ej:] shows up in other ones

- Batman and Will Styler are different individuals

	- ... or so Will wants you to think!
	
---

### So, that's three different perspectives on phonemic analysis

- You can look at the data and see when the meaning changes

- You can look at perception, and see what changes listeners "hear"

- You can look at the distribution, and see what sounds occur when.

## Cool.  So... how do we do phonemic analysis?

---

### Step 0: Check for minimal pairs

If you have a minimal pair where the meaning changes, the sounds are different phonemes and your work is done.  Always.

---

### If you have a minimal pair, the sounds are different phonemes and your work is done.

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/bankvault.jpg">

---

### Phonemic Analysis in four easy steps!

- 0: Check for Minimal Pairs, if none...

- 1: Collect all the environments the sound you’re interested in can occur in

- 2: State the distribution of the sounds. 

- 3: Decide which allophone is the basic *underlying* form
	
- 4: Write rules to derive the other allophone(s) from it based on environment

---

### 0: Check for Minimal Pairs, if none...

- Please.  PLEASE.

---

### 1: Collect all the environments the sound you’re interested in can occur in

- Write down what follows and precedes them

- Use __ to help focus your brain on the context

---

### 2: State the distribution of the sounds. 

- "This one occurs before/after/around/near __"
	
- Sometimes you can only describe where one happens

- Test hypotheses!

---

### 3: Decide which allophone is the basic *underlying* form

- Choose the one you can't predict

- Often it's the “everywhere else” allophone

---

### 4: Write rules to derive the other allophone(s) from it based on environment

- We'll talk about writing rules more shortly

---

### All sorts of environments trigger changes

- Adjacent sound or sounds

- Adjacent *types* of sound

- Word boundaries

- Syllable boundaries

- Sounds or later earlier in the word

	- This is a bit more rare, but really neat!

---

# Phonological Rules

---

### So, you've figured out that sounds are allophones of the same phoneme!

- They're in a *complementary* distribution

- You can predict which one will show up based on the environment

- **How do I express that prediction to somebody else?**

---

### Phonological Rules

You describe the distribution of the allophones of a phoneme with phonological rules

---

### Phonological Rule Format

- "X turns into Y in environment Z"

- “X -> Y” means “X turns into Y”

	- -> is an arrow, but just easier to type.

- Then the “/” which means “in the environment”

- Then you add a blank, representing where the sound goes that's getting transformed  “__”

- ... And you position that blank relative to the conditioning environment.

---

### If /n/ turns to an /ŋ/ before velar sounds...

- /n/ -> [ŋ]  / __ [velar sounds]

- If it happened after velar sounds...

- /n/ -> [ŋ]  / [velar sounds] __

---

### Other Symbols

- "#" means “the boundary of a word”

- “V” means “any vowel” 

- “C” means “any consonant”

- "ø" means "Nothing"

	- A /t/ being deleted is /t/ -> ø / ...

	- A /t/ being inserted is ø -> [t] / ...

---

### All of this is on your quick reference chart

- Use it!

---

### Some Phonological Rules

- /t/ -> [t̪] /__[dental C]

- /ej/ -> [ej:] / __[+voice]

- /V/ -> [Ṽ] / __[nasal]

- Bruce Wayne --> Batman / [Crime]__[Crime]

---

### Often, you'll describe entire groups of sounds in your rules

- These groups will all share a 'feature'

	- 'voiceless', 'velar', 'consonants', 'high vowels'

- [stops] -> [fricatives] / __[back vowels]

- Any group of sounds which share an articulatory feature can be called a 'natural class'

- We'll talk more about these next time

---

### You'll hear about 'allomorphs'

- These are chunks of meaning ('morphemes') like the plural /s/ or past tense /d/ which change depending on nearby sounds

- The English plural "s" can be [s], [z], or [ɪz]

	- Cats, Dogs, and Dishes

- The English past tense "ed" can be [t], [d], or [əd]

	- "Walked", "Buzzed", "Rounded"

---

### One solution to these data

* /-d/ -> [-t] / [voiceless C]__

* /-d/ -> [-d] / [voiced C]__

* /-d/ -> [-ɪd] / [alveolar stop/tap]__

- *The English past is more complicated than this, in practice!*

### This one's awesome (and allophonic!)

- /d/ -> [ð] / V__V

- Also, /b/ -> [β] / V__V

- And, /g/ -> [ɣ] / V__V

- "Voiced stops become fricatives at the same place of articulation between vowels"

### Whoa.  You're doing Phonology!

- Amazing!

---

### Wrapping up

- Phonology is the study of how sounds pattern

- Phonemic analysis is how we determine which sounds have an identity in the language

	- ... and which are just personas of other sounds
	
- Will *may* be Batman

- Phonology is fun!

---

### Next time

- Four common phonological processes

- Phonotactics

- More data!

### Study Groups aren't always a good idea!

- Sometimes it can help to teach and learn from others

- Don't trust an answer you don't fully understand

	- "What's the answer?" is dangerous, "Why is that the answer?" might save you.

- Bad answers often 'go viral'

	- I can usually tell a study group by the patterns of weird errors
	
	- "Somebody who was very wrong thought they were very right!"

- The very best study group is office hours!

### Will Styler - LIGN 101
              
---

### Today's Plan

- Review

- Common Phonological Processes

- Natural Classes

- Let's work some problems!

---

# Reviewing Phonemic Analysis

---

## A Phoneme

- The Smallest Contrastive Unit of Sound in a language, in a *contrastive distribution* with other phonemes in the language

- Changing phonemes changes meanings, and is perceptible (and often confusing!) for listeners of a language

- Changing between phonemes creates...

---

## Minimal Pairs

- Two words with different meanings which differ by a single sound, indicating that those sounds are **different phonemes**

- Think "boot" and "boon", or "Niña" and "Piña"

---

## Allophones of a Phoneme

- Different surface-level expressions of the same phoneme, which *alternate* depending on the environment, in a *complementary distribution*

- Which allophone you get is dictated by a rule

- Think about [ej] and [ej:] or the many realizations of /t/ in English

---

## Underlying Form

- The sound which you decide is the 'base' form, from which rules create the other allophones

- This is a *strategic* decision.  Choose the form that lets you write the fewest, cleanest rules.

---

## Allomorphs

- Different versions of morphemes which are swapped predictably based on the sound environment.

- Think the many plurals of English, 

---

## Free Variation

- Where a group of sounds can replace each other, or not, and there's no pattern, just chaos

- **Don't worry about this for LIGN 101, we won't give you Free Variation on homeworks or exams**

---

### Sounds have relationships with one another

- They can be *independent* phonemes

- They can be *rule-governed* allophones

- They can *chaotically switching* free variation

---

### Signs that two sounds represent different phonemes

- **Minimal pairs**

- Speakers hear them as 'entirely distinct'

- There's *no pattern besides changes in meaning which predicts their distribution*

---

### Signs that two sounds are allophones of the same phoneme

- Changing the environment causes the sounds to *alternate*

- The two sounds are predictable

	- "Huh, this one always occurs in that environment!"

- Speakers hear switching between them as 'a different way of saying' the same thing

	- Or maybe don't hear the difference at all
	
---

### We write phonological rules to describe where allophones occur

- These rules tell us *when* some or all of the forms occur

---

### These rules have formatting conventions

- '\_' replaces the sound which is being changed

- '\#' means 'word boundaries'

	- Think of 'cat' as being like [\#kæt\#]
	- \_\# is at the end of a word
	- \#\_ is at the start of a word
	
---

### Aside: Schwa is always an allophone of another vowel

- Schwa (/ə/) is a reduced form of a different vowel

	- Photograph, the, con'vict

- Wedge (/ʌ/) is a specific vowel, with its own identity

	- Not a reduced form of something else

---

### So, now we know how alternations work!

---

### ... but why do alternations occur anyways?

---

# Common Phonological Processes

---

### So, now we know how to describe all these crazy rules...

- ## ... but what do languages actually DO with them?!

---

### Four Common Types of Phonological Processes

- Assimilation

- Dissimilation

- Insertion / Epenthesis

- Deletion / Elision

---

### 1) Assimilation

- When sounds change to become more like one another

- This is basically Peer Pressure

- <img class="r-stretch" src="phonology/assimilation.jpg">

---

### Example: Nasal Place Assimilation

- "Come on, we're all being dental, you should try it too!"

- "Pine thugs" -> [pajn̪ θʌgz]

- "Pine guys" -> [pajŋ gajz]

---

### Extreme Example: Nasal Harmony

- When other phones in a word change to match the nasality of a nasal segment

- <img class="r-stretch" src="phonology/nasal_harmony.jpg">

    - "If I'm going to be nasal, you're all going to be nasal with me, damnit!"

    - <small>From Epeda Pedee, in Rose, S. and Walker, R. (2011). Harmony Systems. In The Handbook of Phonological Theory (eds J. Goldsmith, J. Riggle and A. C. Yu). doi:10.1002/9781444343069.ch8 </small>
    
- This also happens with vowels (e.g. Turkish) and elsewhere

---

### Extreme Example: Vowel Harmony

When vowels change to match the other vowels in the word

---

### Turkish has back-front vowel harmony

* This means that vowels in a word must be either *all back* or *all front*

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/turkishvowels.png">
---

<lang>Turkish</lang><br><ldata>Turkic - Turkey</ldata> 

*Türkiye’-dir* - ‘it is Turkey’

* *kapı-dır* - ‘it is the door’

* *gül-dür* - 'it is the rose’

* *palto-dur* - ‘it is the coat’

* *The vowel in the last syllable changes depending on the other vowels!*

---

### 2) Dissimilation

- When sounds change to become *less* like one another

- <img class="r-stretch" width="600" src="phonology/the_crow.jpg">

---

### Example: Liquid Dissimilation

- The third rural bird juror murderer demurred.

- "Colonel" is pronounced /kəɹnəl/
    
- "Purple" comes from "purpure"

- “surprise” /səɹpɹajz/ is usually /səpɹajz/, same with “berserk” and "february"

	- This is deletion, done for dissimilation reasons

---

### 3) Insertion / Epenthesis

- When a sound pops up to prevent an awkward or undesirable combination

- Basically, showing up on a friend's bad date

- <img class="r-stretch" src="phonology/third_wheel.jpg">

---

### Example: Allomorphs with vowels

- /dɪʃ/ + /s/ -> [dɪʃɪz]

- /ɹat/ + /d/ -> [ɹaɾɪd]

- The vowel 'pops in' to stop /ʃs/ and /td/ from being a thing

- Languages also LOVE to epenthesize to stop VV

---

### 4) Deletion / Elision

- When a sound is removed to stop an awkward or undesirable combination from occurring

- Basically, uninviting your friend's ex from the party

- <img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/lonely_panda.jpg">

---

### Example: Elision in English

- Fifth, /fɪfθs/ -> [fɪθs]

- Family, /fæmɪli/ -> [fæmli]

- Natural, /næt͡ʃəɹəl/ -> [næt͡ʃɹəl]

---

### Four Common Types of Phonological Processes

- Assimilation (Peer Pressure)

- Dissimilation (Rebellion)

- Insertion / Epenthesis (Showing up on a friend's date)

- Deletion / Elision (Uninviting and unfriending)

---

### There are other phonological processes

- They're all awesome

- ... but those four are super common

---

### I'm humanizing these patterns for a reason

- Before you start looking for a pattern, think about what’s changing, arising, or deleting, and what kinds of things might trigger it

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### If a language changes /d/ to next to a voiceless C, that's an example of...

A) Assimilation

B) Dissimilation

C) Insertion / Epenthesis

D) Deletion / Elision

---

### If a language changes /d/ to /t/ next to a voiceless C, that's an example of...

A) <correct>Assimilation</correct>

B) Dissimilation

C) Insertion / Epenthesis

D) Deletion / Elision

---

### What kinds of things trigger these changes?

---

# Natural Classes

---

### Plural Patterns in English

- [z] after /j g d ɹ n w b m ð l i aj v u ow/ 

- [s] after /t p k f θ/

- [ɪz] after /tʃ dʒ s ʃ z/

---

### A few reasons why listing sounds is no good

- Lists are *inefficient*

- Lists treat these phenomena as *unmotivated*

- Lists *disguise relationships* among sounds

- Lists aren't *graceful*

---

### Relationships among speech sounds are real

- Phonology is not just algebra with symbols

- Your IPA chart is not just an arbitrary scattering of sounds

- Phonetic motivation for changes is often based on geography

---

### Relationships can be described in many ways

- ... but the easiest way to start thinking is in terms of...

---

# Natural Classes!

---

### Let's play a game!

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/sesame_street.jpg">

---

### One of these sounds is not like the other...

## /t/ /k/ /p/ /s/

- /s/ is the only fricative, all the rest are voiceless stops

---

## /m/ /n/ /ŋ/ /b/

- /b/ is the only oral sound, all the rest are nasal sounds

---

## /b/ /a/ /ŋ/ /i/ /s/

- /s/ is the only voiceless sound, all the rest are voiced sounds

- /n/ is the only nasal sound, all the rest are oral

---

## /l/ /s/ /ŋ/ /j/ /i/

- /i/ is the only vowel, all the rest are consonants

- /s/ is the only voiceless sound

- /ŋ/ is the only nasal

---

## /i/ /ɪ/ /ɛ/ /æ/ /ɔ/

- /ɔ/ is the only back vowel, all the rest are front vowels

- /ɔ/ is the only rounded vowel, all the rest are unrounded

---

## /t/ /n/ /s/ /z/ /k/

- /k/ is the only non-alveolar sound

- /n/ is the only nasal sound, all the rest are oral

---

## /p/ /t/ /k/ /b/

- /b/ is the only voiced stop

---

## Natural Class

A set of speech sounds in a given language that is able to be uniquely, completely, and succinctly described in terms of the shared phonetic (“natural”) properties of its members.
    
---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/ipa_chart.jpg">

---

### Natural Class Examples

- Voiceless stops (English & Spanish): [p, t, k]

- Voiced fricatives (English): [v, ð, z, ʒ]

- Voiced fricatives (Spanish): [β, ð, ɣ]

- Front vowels (English): [iː, ɪ, eɪ, ɛ, æ]

- Front vowels (Spanish): [i, e]

---

### Natural Classes in spoken languages are usually very IPA-like

- Common rows, columns, or regions on the IPA chart

- Anything where you can say 'these share a feature in speech production'

- *Knowing the IPA is hugely helpful in phonology!*

---


### Phonological Rules *typically* involve natural classes

- Natural classes can be the 'targets' of rules

    - [p t k] are aspirated in English
    
- Natural classes can 'trigger' rules

    - [tʃ dʒ s ʃ z] trigger the [ɪz] plural
    
- Very often, rules will act on groups of sounds which share features

---

### So, as you're writing your phonological rules...

- ## Keep it classy!

	- (Naturally)
	
---

## Any questions?

---

## Now, let's try some datasets

---

### What is the relationship between [j] and [w] here?

---

### DO NOT LOOK AT THIS UNTIL YOU'VE WORKED THE PROBLEM

---

### /t/ -> [s] / V___

- This is the best answer

- [t] shows up in many more contexts than [s], so it's underlying!

- It is incorrect to say something like '/t/ becomes [s] in 'less' words'.

	- **Phonology just worries about sounds**

---

### Next time

- We'll wrap up phonology, and talk about how words work

# Phonology: The Sound Patterns of Language are really, really awesome

### Will Styler - LIGN 101
              
---

### Today's Plan

- Signed language Phonology

- Syllables are fun

- Phonotactics

- Phonology Q/A

- Language Background

---

## Signed Language Phonology

---

### Phonology isn't just for spoken languages

- Signed languages have phonology too!

---

### Signed languages have parameters

- Handshape

- Orientation

- Movement

- Location

- Expression

---

### All of these parameters can participate in rules and natural classes

- They act just like phonetic features (e.g. velar, voiced, stop, fricative)

- Assimilation/Dissimilation/Epenthesis/Deletion of gestures

- Similar approaches to rule-writing can describe the process

	- Feature -> Variant / [context]_ 

- The *exact same* principles and approaches apply

- Minimal pairs are also a thing!

### WHITE - LIKE

---

### PAPER - CHEESE

<img class="small" src="img/asl_paper.gif"><img class="small" src="img/asl_cheese.gif">

---

### There is one big difference!

- Parameters in sign are often Simultaneous

	- Spoken language is mostly sequential, with sequences of sounds

- Signed language involves many simultaneous parameters affecting one another

- This leads to interesting dimensionality in interactions

---

### Signed language is language

- Damnit

---

# Syllables

---

### Syllables seem to be pretty important in some languages

- English is among them.

- English speakers have an intuitive sense of syllables

---

### Let's try

- Under

    - /ʌn.dəɹ/

- Decoagulate

    - /di.kow.æg.ju.lejt/

- Antipenultimate

    - /æn.ti.pɛ.nʌl.tɪm.ɪt/

---

### Linguists break the syllable into three parts

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/syllable_simple.jpg">

### Linguists break the syllable into three parts

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/syllable.jpg">

---

### Let's look at some syllables

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/syll_fences.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/syll_strengths.jpg">

---

### Phonological rules will often reference syllables

- English /l/ becomes [ɫ] in the coda position

- /ɛ/ is illegal in words without a coda in English

- Spanish will often re-syllabify words to turn codas into onsets

    - "Van a gritar a las olas" ('They will yell at the waves')

- **So, they're good to think about!**

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### In the word 'star', the coda is...

A) /st/

B) /a/

C) /ɹ/

D) /aɹ/

E) /taɹ/

---

### In the word 'star', the coda is...

A) /st/

B) /a/

C) <correct>/ɹ/</correct>

D) /aɹ/

E) /taɹ/

---

### English Aspiration

- We've been ignoring this all quarter

- But there's more to /t/ than [t]

### /t/ is aspirated at the start of a syllable!

- ... not just in the onset!

- So are /p/ and /k/

- Those sounds share a feature!

- They're a *natural class*

---

### The English [d] is the same sound as the Spanish [t]

---

### Different languages have different syllable structures

- This is an important element of...

---

# Phonotactics

---

### Phonotactics

The study of what sounds and combinations of sounds are 'legal' in a language

---

### Every language has a set of phonemes which are used

- This is called a language's **Phonemic Inventory**

    - Sometimes 'phonological inventory'

- Every language has one.

    - ... and you can find it [at PHOIBLE](https://phoible.org/)

### Malayalam

---

### A language's phonological inventory is important!

- It tells you which phonemes are legal to use

- It tells you what the 'options' are when there are alternations

- It will play a big role in your analysis

- It really complicates word borrowings!

### Hawaiian is an Indigenous language of Hawai'i

---

### Hawaiian has an atypically small number of consonants

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonology/inventory_hawaiian.jpg">

---

### How do speakers of Hawaiian borrow words from English?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/enhawaiianborrowings.png"> 

---

### Let's look at some English-to-Hawaiian Borrowings

---

### Iniseka

* Insect

---

### Elepani

* Elephant

---

### hipa

* Sheep

---

### kaioke

* Coyote

---

### Kanakalu

* Kangaroo

---

### Lakuna

* Raccoon

---

### Nupepa

* Newspaper

---

### Mokokaikala

* Motorcycle

---

### Kakalina

* Gasoline

---

### Kelepona

* Telephone

---

### Kolokalaiwa

* Screwdriver

---

### But languages also differ in terms of the combinations they allow

---

### Phonotactic Constraints dictate what combinations are 'legal'

- Some sounds can't happen at the start or end of words

- Some sound combinations can't happen

- Some syllable structures are favored or prevented

---

### English has some weird phonotactic constraints

* End a word with a pronounced /h/ ("Bah")

* Say the /ŋ/ in "ring" at the start of a word. ("Ngöndro")

* End a word with the vowel in "bet" or "book". ("Saké")

* English has "s", "k", "v", but say "Moskva"

---

### So do other languages

- ... and these come into play when we're borrowing words

- Languages adapt words to fit their phonotactic constraints when borrowing.

---

### Japanese requires all syllables to be CV

- This means that borrowing from English (which has no such constraint) is complicated

## Language Background

### Let's think about language background a bit more

### "L1" vs. "L2" shorthand

- L1 is a 'native' language which you've learned well, generally as a child or young adult

- L2 is an 'acquired' language which you didn't grow up speaking, but have acquired later on

	- Many levels of fluency are possible

- 'Heritage Speakers' have learned a language informally through exposure at home or from relatives, but may never have learned in school or spoken extensively outside the home

	- Many levels of fluency are possible

---

### The 'Native Speaker' problem

- What exactly is a 'native speaker' of a language?

- Where does this leave bilinguals?

- What about people who learned English as L2, but have used it more than their L1 in their lifetimes?

- What about heritage speakers?

- [See Cheng et al. 2022 for more discussion of this issue](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.715843/full)

---

### More useful ways to think about language background

- Which language(s) did you learn first?

- Which language(s) do you use most often?

- Which language(s) do you feel conversationally fluent in?  

- Which language(s) do you have grammatical intuitions in?

- Which language(s) would you prefer to use in a given context?

- Which language(s) do you identify with, or feel an allegiance towards?

---

### Language background is complicated

- Every person has a rich language background

- This is important to consider as we do linguistic work

- ... and trying to compact it down to one dimension or 'term' isn't a great plan!

---

### Next time

- We'll dive into how words work

<huge>Thank you!</huge>




## Week 4

$ LIGN 101 - Morphology

### Please visit office hours if you have questions!

- IA office hours are often empty and sad!

- If you don't 'get' phonology or IPA yet, go, let them help you

	- They have more datasets and they want to help!

- Also check out the Video on the Bantu dataset

- It's a good idea to review the lecture notes before sections

---

### Please be conscientious with exception and extension requests

- If you just started the assignment shortly before asking for the extension, it's not happening

	- We drop an assignment for everybody, precisely to help you make a mistake without hurting too badly

	- I have a [whole site talking about how to make good and bad requests](https://savethevowels.org/gradechanges).

- If you put in the work for us, we'll bend over backwards for you, but we have to be fair to everybody!

# Morphology: How words are built

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---
 	 	 	  
### Today's Plan

- What is morphology?

- Types of morphemes

- Types of words

- Building new words

---

# What is Morphology?

---

## Morphology

- The study of the shape and formation of words


---

### Words are often not monolithic

- They're often made of smaller components

- These components are called '**morphemes**'

	- The smallest piece of a word which expresses a meaning or function

---

## How do we know that English has a past tense marker like -ed?

---

### Form-Meaning Correspondences

- We can detect these components by looking for correspondences between form and meaning

- "If the same meaning keeps showing up with the same form in a word, that chunk of form must carry meaning!"

---

### Forming English Plurals

- /kæt/ vs /kæts/

- /sit/ vs. /sits/

- /pat/ vs. /pats/

- "Huh, it sure looks like words with -s at the end are plural. '-s' must be a meaningful chunk!"

- These recurring chunks that seem to have meaning are **morphemes**

---

### Many words are composed of many morphemes

- *... and each morpheme's meaning contributes to the word's meaning!*

- played (play-ed)
 	- play + past tense
 	
- blacken (black-en)
 	- black + ‘cause to become’
 	
- unroll (un-roll)
 	- reverse of ‘roll’
 	
- depressurization (de-pressure-ize-ation)
 	- undo + pressure + verbalizer + nominalizer

---

### There are two kinds of morpheme

- Bound, and Free Morphemes

---

### Free Morphemes

- Can stand on their own, do not have to attach to some other form
  
- Cat, Show, Class, Panda, Walk, Purple

---

### Bound Morphemes

- Can’t stand on their own, must be attached to some other morpheme

 	- -ed,  -s,  -ing,  -er,  un-, -aholic, cran-

---

### Bound Morphemes (or 'Affixes')

- **Prefixes** - Go before the root

 	- Re-do, Un-screw, Over-come

- **Suffixes** - Go after the root

 	- walk-ed, cat-s, end-ing

- **Infixes** - Go inside the root

 	- Khmer: leun ‘fast’ -> l-b-eun ‘speed’
 	
- **Circumfixes** - Go to either side of the root

 	- German: spielen 'to play' -> ge-spiel-t 'played'

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### -or in 'refrigerator' is an example of an...

A) Prefix

B) Suffix

### -or in 'refrigerator' is an example of an...

A) Prefix

B) <correct>Suffix</correct>

C) Infix

D) Circumfix

E) Bush-fix

---

### So, those are morphemes

- There are many, *many* kinds of morphemes

- Accomplishing many tasks

- ... and they're the building blocks of *words*

---

# Words

---

### Words are made up of morphemes

- Sometimes just one, sometimes many

 	- We'll spend some time there later today

- ... but once constructed, words have many different types

---

### Lexical Categories

- Also known as "Parts of Speech"

- The *types* of words which occur in language

---

### Lexical Categories

- **Nouns**: bike, car, cat, dog, tofu, dude, bling

- **Verbs:** go, eat, talk, walk

- **Adjectives:** lit, sweet, hot, cool, awesome

- **Adverbs:** well, fast, slowly, easily

- **Pre/postpositions:** with, from, on, in

---

### Lexical Categories (continued)

- **Determiners:** the, a, that, this, those

- **Pronouns:** she, he, him, her, it, I, you, they

- **Conjunctions:** and, or, whenever, while

- **Numeral:** one, twice, third

- **Interjection:** ouch, tsk, damnit!

---

### How do we identify the different parts of speech?

- These generalizations will work for English, but similar ones are available

---

### Nouns

- Describe a person, place or thing

- Can be singular or plural

 	- book/books or car/cars, but not quickly/ &#42;quicklys and beg/ &#42;begs
 	- red/reds?

- Can be paired with a determiner (e.g. "I like the/a...")

 	- I like the book/car/cat/show
 	
 	- \*I like the angry/rotate/beg/quickly

---

### Verbs

- Can take tense marking in English

 	- He rotates, she rotated
 	- He learns, she learned
 	- &#42;He angrys, &#42;He angryed

- Can work with modals

 	- I will teach, but &#42;I will angry.
 	- I can run, but &#42;I can laptop.

---

### Adjectives

- Comparative Constructions

 	- Happy/Happier, but &#42;teacher/teacher
 	- Angry/Angrier, but &#42;cat/cater

- Superlative Constructions

 	- Mad/Maddest, but &#42;commute/commutest
 	- Purple/Purplest, but &#42;penguin/penguinest

- Very/too Constructions

 	- Very bad, very angry, very purple, very ugly
 	- &#42;Very teach, &#42;Very cat, &#42;Very linguist

---

### There are always some exceptions

- Words can be used as other categories

 	- "Wow, that's so fly"

 	- "You look very... linguist today"

 	- "I can't adult right now"

- Words that don't fit the pattern

 	- &#42;She looks much eleganter
 	- &#42;I cutted the bush
 	- &#42;Three sheeps ran across the path
 	
---

### Adverbs are hard

- "the most nebulous and puzzling of the traditional word classes”

 	- (Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, & Svartvik, 1985)

- They can modify anything non-nominal

- ![](morphology/adverb_modification.jpg)

---

### There are many flavors of adverbs

- **Temporal**: Now, then, yesterday, always, tomorrow, next week

- **Locative**: Here, there, abroad

- **Sentence**: Perhaps, fortunately, honestly, frankly

- **Manner**: Quickly, carefully, excitedly, beautifully

- **Linking**: Therefore, thus, consequently

- **Degree**: Very, too, extremely

---

### Prepositions

- Indicate a semantic relationship between other entities

 	- "Any relationship a squirrel can have with a tree"

 	- Under, around, on top of, behind, near, adjacent to, below, above, in, on...

- These don't change form in English

---

### Postpositions

- Many languages instead use **postpositions**, which go after the thing(s) they modify but function like prepositions.

- English doesn't have postpositions, but Turkish does!

Çocuk-lar **bahçe-de** oyn-uyor.  
Kid-PL garden-in play-ing (PROG).  
'Kids are playing in the garden.''

- About [half of the languages in WALS](https://wals.info/feature/85A#2/16.3/152.9) use postpositions

- Inpositions and circumpositions are a thing too

---

### Pronouns

- Substitute for noun phrases

 	- "I saw the gal who Kati noticed was carrying a hamster in her backpack"
 	
 	- "I saw **her**"
 	
---

### There are many kinds of pronouns

- Personal Pronouns

 	- 1st Person (I, me, mine), 2nd person (You, Yours), 3rd (she/her/hers, he/him/his, them/them/theirs, and others)
 	
- Indefinite Pronouns

 	- Someone, everybody, nobody, any, anything, something
 	
- Interrogative Pronouns

 	- "You saw who/what where/when?"
 	
- Relative pronouns

 	- "I saw the girl **who** knew the cat **that** ate the bird **which** I was watching."
 	
- Demonstrative pronouns

 	- This, these, that, those
 	
---

### Determiners

- Determiners mark and precede nouns

- **The/an** interesting book
- **Those** cookies
- **Which** movie did you see?

- Determiners don't vary in form

---

### Types of Determiners

- **Possessive**: My, your, her, our, his, its, their

- **Demonstrative**: This, these, that, those

- **Interrogative**: which, what, whose

- **Definite**: the

- **Indefinite**: a/an

---

### My favorite determiner joke

---

> 'The' and 'a' walk into a bar. 'A' says, "Hey, what's up bro, I haven't seen you in ages.  Are you still marking noun phrases?" 'The' replies "Definitely!"

---

### Conjunctions

- Used to link expressions

- Sunny **and** warm

- Red **or** blue?

- He rolled over **while** I was petting him.

---

### Let's practice a bit

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### "The [tiny] dog quickly scurried between the buildings"

A) Noun

B) Verb

C) Adjective

D) Preposition

E) Adverb

<section class="clicker"></section>

### "The tiny dog quickly scurried [between] the buildings"

A) Noun

B) Verb

C) Adjective

D) Preposition

E) Adverb

---

### All languages have grammatical categories

- Although the lines between them can be blurrier or cleaner

- ... and some languages don't necessarily use all of them

---

### We can group these categories into larger sets

- Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs are **content words**

 	- A very large set of words, which express new meanings

- Pre/Postpositions, Determiners, Pronouns, Conjunctions are **function words**

 	- A small, finite set of words which help combine other words

---

### Content and Function words change differently in languages

- We very rarely gain new **Function words** (Pre/Postpositions, Determiners, Pronouns, Conjunctions)

- We often gain new **Content words** (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs)

- Function words are a **closed class**, and content words are an **open class**

---

### New function words are pretty rare

- "I didn't see the last Transformers movie **because** Michael Bay" (new preposition)

- "I spent last night in the library doing homework **slash** looking at pictures of cats" (new conjunction)

---

### New content words are really common

- Bae (Noun)

- Twerk (Verb)

- Rekt (Adjective)

- No cap (Adverb)

- Yeet (Verb)

---

### Wait, how do you create a new word, anyways?

---

# Creating New Words

- This is called *polysemy* and we'll talk about this a lot down the road!

---

### Word creation methods

- Compounding

- Blending

- Borrowing from other languages

- Changing the part of speech

- Clipping

- Acronyms and Initialism

---

### What other words or morphemes are new lately?

---

### Wrapping up 

- Morphology is the study of how words are built

- Words are made of Morphemes

- Morphemes have different types

- Words have different types

- Words are made in many ways

---

### Next time

- We'll finish up with morphology

	- Then we're going to look at a very strange language... **English**

## Week 4

$ LIGN 101 - Morphology 2 and English is drunk

### Adriano Celentano - Prisencolinensinainciusol

<video controls src="video/prisencolinensinainciusol_adriano_celentano.mp4"></video>

---

### Back up your computers

- If your hard drive or computer failed tomorrow, what would you do?

- Keep a copy of important non-private documents on Google Drive or iCloud

- Buy an external drive and backup your whole machine

 	- Time Machine on Mac, Windows Backup on PC

 	- Or Backblaze, rsync, etc

- Seriously, *your computer will likely die while you're at UCSD*, be prepared
 
---

## Morphology 2, and English is Drunk

### LIGN 101 - Will Styler

---

### Today's Plan
- How do languages generally make words? (Morphological Type)

- Inflection vs. Derivation

- Where to draw the line between morphology and phonology?

- Go home, English, you're drunk

---

### Do languages differ in how they like to build their words?

- Of course!

---


## Morphological Type

---

### Morphological Type

A means of categorizing how languages put words together

- This is useful for comparing word-building strategies *across languages*

---

We care about two "dimensions" of morphological type:

* ***Do words have lots of morphemes or few?***

* ***If they have multiple morphemes, do they blend together, or are they easy to pick apart?***

---

### Do words have lots of morphemes or few?

* If words have few morphemes (like English or Chinese), they're "isolating"

* If they have many (like Spanish or German), they're "synthetic"

	* Languages where whole sentences are single words are sometimes called "polysynthetic"

---

<lang>English</lang><br><ldata>IE:Germanic - All over</ldata>

### It's always a continuum

* English is isolating, but Mandarin is *more* isolating

* Few languages are as polysynthetic as Wichita, but that's OK!
	
---

### Morphological Type - Review!

* If a language has few morphemes per word, it's *isolating*

* If the language has multiple morphemes per word, it's *synthetic*

---


### So far, we've been talking about building *new words*

- "How do I create a new word that I can use in a sentence?"

---

### This is called 'Derivational Morphology'

---

### Derivational Morphology

- Attaching affixes that change the part of speech of the root, or change something important about the meaning

- The meaning changes don't apply to all words, and are sometimes unpredictable

---

### Examples of Derivational Morphology

- control (verb) -> controllable (adjective)

- amaze (verb) -> amazement (noun)

- joy (noun) -> joyful (adjective)

- teach (verb) -> teacher (noun)

- roll (verb) -> unroll (verb)

- write (verb) -> rewrite (verb)

- fair (adjective) -> unfair (adjective)

---

### Inflectional Morphology

- Inflectional morphology predictably changes the meaning of the word in the sentence, but doesn't change the part of speech or meaning of the whole word in a deep way.

- Inflectional morphology is *often added at the time of speaking*

---

### Examples of Inflectional Morphology in English

- cat -> cats (-s plural marker)
- we sing -> he sings (-s 3rd person singular marker)
- he walks -> he walked (-ed 3sg past tense marker)

---

### Inflectional Morphology around the World

---

### Khanty (Western Siberia)

xot 'house'

- xot-yyn 'two houses (dual)'

- xot-yt 'houses (plural)'

---

### Russian (Transliterated)

- Devushk-a videt sobak-u

  - The girl sees the dog
  
- Devushk-u videt sobak-a

  - The dog sees the girl
  
- This is a *case system*.  We'll hopefully talk more about those later.

---

### Somali

- xoola-hayga 'my herd'

- xoola-haaga 'your herd'

- xoola-heeda 'her herd'

- xooli-hiisa 'his herd'

---

### Spanish

- Habl-o 'I speak (Present tense)'

- Habl-as 'You speak (Present tense)'

- Habl-a 'He/She/It speaks (Present tense)'

- Habl-amos 'We speak (Present tense)'

- Habl-ais 'Y'all speak (Present tense)'

- Habl-an 'They speak (Present tense)'

---

### English: "Mom, can we stop and get inflectional morphology?"

- ### Mom: "We have inflectional Morphology at home"

---

### Inflectional morphology at home:

<img class="r-stretch" src="morphology/english_inflectional.jpg"> 

---

### So, we have derivational and inflectional morphology

- Derivational morphology is used to build new words

- Inflectional morphology changes their meanings in predictable ways in sentences

- The line between these can get blurry in some cases

- Most languages do a bit of each!

---

## Now, for something completely different

---

## Language Warning

* We discuss Language

	* All of it

* We may discuss taboo subjects, words, constructions, or concepts

* It's all meant to further academic pursuits

* Please come talk to me if you have any concerns.

---

## Go home English, you're drunk

### LING 101 - Will Styler

---

### "Why can't these immigrants just learn English?!?"

---

## "Uh, have you looked at English lately??"

---

### Nearly every part of this language is completely bizarre.

* Non-Native Speakers: You know the deal.

---

Let's look at this from an outsider's perspective

---

## The Sound System

---

### /ɹ/eally?

* Very few languages use /ɹ/

	* Mandarin Chinese shares this crazy

* We've got a bunch of ways to make it

---

![](phonmedia/englishr.jpg)

---

## Intonation

---

### The prosody, or pitch and timing you use, matters a lot

- "I had Five Guys for lunch yesterday."

- "Let's eat, Grandma!"

- "I'm so sorry to hear about your exam score"

- List intonation

---

## Vocabulary

---

### English has done a **lot** of theft

---

**English**

All *human* beings are born free and *equal* in *dignity* and rights. They are *endowed* with *reason* and *conscience* and should *act* towards one *another* in a *spirit* of brotherhood.

**French**

Tous les êtres humains naissent libres et égaux en dignité et en droits. Ils sont doués de raison et de conscience et doivent agir les uns envers les autres dans un esprit de fraternité.

- "I just downloaded a new YouTube app.  It's a great YouTuber."

- "Mark builds armor, he's an armorer.  Steven builds hooks, he's a ..."

### ... but it has exactly one infix

---

### Infix

A affix which is inserted into the middle of the word 
 
---

Will I tell you what it is?

* ### Abso-fucking-lutely

---

### "Fucking" is the only infix in the English language

* ... and it has very strict rules where it can go

It's time to talk about these issues

---

## It

---

It ate my homework

* It's getting hot in here

* It burns when I eat Habañeros

* It sucks when Michael Bay remakes your childhood favorites

* It's about time we fix our writing system

---

### Expletive 'it'

- Contributes nothing to the meaning of the sentence

    - ... but does serve a syntactic role
    
- "It" is a subject for sentences where there's no subject at all

---

### Shouldn't we do something about that?

* Which means the same thing as "Should we do something about that?"

	* Go home English, you're drunk.

		* (Shouldn't that be "drinked")?

---

### I give up

* Speaking of which...

---

## Verb particle constructions

---

### Verb Particle Constructions

When a verb has a different meaning when coupled with a particular preposition or particle

---

### Cut - to slice

* Cut in - To offer somebody a part of a venture

* Cut out - To stop something, or remove somebody from a venture, or lose audio

* Cut with - To adulterate a drug

* Cut off - To cease financial support, or merge leaving too little space

	* ... or remove a smaller part than the whole

* Cut it - To suffice for a task

---

### Cut continued

* Cut up - To slice into small pieces

* Cut down - To shorten something

* Cut across/through - To shorten one's route by traversing an open space

* Cut on - To repeatedly make small cutting strokes at the periphery of an object

* Cut back - To reduce an existing option or investment, travel back in story

---

Sometimes, we don't know if we want the verb particle construction, or the preposition!

---

### *Cut up the center of the fabric*

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/cutup1.png">

---

### *Cut up the center of the fabric*

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/cutup2.png">

---

### These differences can have major consequences

---

### "Jackie stole my lunchbox..."

* "... then she threw my lunch up on the roof"

* "... then she threw up my lunch on the roof"

---

## We have other particles

---

### The 'to' in 'to go'

- Apparently, syntacticians have punted on this and call it a 'particle'

- In computational linguistics, we just call it 'to' and wash our hands of it

- Either way, it's going to cause problems

    - Like 'it'

---


### Then there's the really crazy stuff

---

*Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.*

* This is a fully grammatical sentence

	* Buffalo NY, Buffalo (the animal), and the verb "buffalo" (to bully)

* "New York bison whom other New York bison bully, themselves bully New York bison".

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/surprisedbuffalo.jpg">

---

### Will, will Will will Will Will's will?

- Also fully grammatical English

	- Will (being addressed), will (future) Will (a person) will (bequeath) Will (another person) Will's will (a document).

---

## It's not just English!

---

### English happens to be absolutely insane

* It's filled with irregularities, weirdnesses, odd constructions, and other silliness

* *... but that's no different than any other language.*

---

## All languages are crazy!

* We're simplifying languages left and right for this class

	* Partly because we don't have the time

	* ... and because if we didn't, you'd run screaming

---

### The Tibetan Writing system is even worse than English's

![](lotwimg/tibetan.jpg)

---

### The Real Russian Case System

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/russiancaseendings.gif"> 

---

### Spanish Verbal Hell

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/spanishverbs.jpg">

---

### ... and that craziness is why linguists love language so much!

---

### Wrapping up

* English is bat-poop cray-cray, in so many ways

	* (Partly because you understood that sentence)

* ... but so is every other language

* That's why we love them

* Second language learners are fighting an uphill battle.  Be kind!

# Syntax: How sentences are built

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---
			  
### Today's Plan

- Grammatical Relations

- Why do we need Syntax?

- Constituency and Constituency Testing

- Syntactic Hierarchy

- Syntax Trees

---

### "Jony chased Dieter"

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/fish_jonydieter.jpg"> 
	
---

## "How do we know who did what to whom?"

---

### Grammatical Relations

How a language marks who did what to whom

---

### Grammatical Relations is kind of crucial

- If you don't know who did what to whom, you've got problems

---

### Languages have different strategies

- Sometimes, you can guess

	- "[ate] [Will] [veggie burger]"

- Many languages use inflectional morphology

	- "This morpheme marks the Subject (do-er), and this marks the Object (do-ee)

- But often, this is accomplished with word order!

---

### English uses word order to mark grammatical relations.

* "Will ate the veggie burger."

* "Jony chased Dieter"

* "Dieter chased Jony"

* "Andres waved to Kati"

* "Will insulted Michael Bay"

---

### English uses word order to mark grammatical relations.

- "Will ate the veggie burger"

- "The veggie burger was eaten by Will"

- "It was the Veggie burgers that Will was eating"

- "And what did Will consume on that dark, dark night?  A VEGGIE BURGER!"

---

### ... so it's clearly more than just word order

- Because you can change the ordering and it still makes sense.

---

### ... yet word order clearly matters

- *Ate Will the Veggie Burger

- *Jony Dieter Chased

- *Will Burger Veggie Ate

---

### ... and then things move around

- "Will ate the veggie burger"

- "Will ate it"

- "Will ate what?"

- "What did Will eat?"

- *"What did Will eat it?"

---

### ... and things get ambiguous

- "Will likes ambiguity more than most people"

	- "Will likes ambiguity more than most people do"

	- "Will likes ambiguity more than he likes most people"

---

### Clearly, it's complicated

- ... and this is why we have...

---

# Syntax!

---

### Syntax is the study of the structure of sentences and utterances

- "What determines the order and arrangement of words in sentences?"

- "What orderings and arrangements are grammatical in a language?"

- "How do we identify the meaning of words given their ordering?"

- "How does the ordering within a sentence change in contexts?"

---

### Syntax is a *huge* subfield in Linguistics

- Very popular

- Very broad

- Very, *very* deep

- ... and very much not Will's area

	- Sorry about that!
	
---

### Let's start from the basics

---

# Constituency

---

### Syntactic Constituent

A group of words which 'go together' in the structure of the sentence

- *Constituents are always a continuous string of words*

	- No skipping words, these are continuous chunks!

---

### Constituents are chunks that, when split off, make sense

---

### We have intuitions about how things can be split

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/kit_kat_cuts_1.jpg">

---

### We know what breaks are "good"

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/kit_kat_cuts_2.jpg">

---

### ... and we know that even if other breaks are possible...

---

### They shouldn't always be done

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/kit_kat_cuts_4.jpg">

---

### Let's break me off a piece of that syntactic structure!

---


### Let's check our intuitions!

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### Which of the following is a complete constituent in the sentence "Will tracked the wild veggie burgers through the forest."

A. [burgers through the]

B. [tracked the wild]

C. [the wild veggie]

D. [wild veggie burgers]

E. [Will tracked the]

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### Which of the following is a *not* complete constituent in the sentence "Will tracked the wild veggie burgers through the forest."

A. [Will]

B. [tracked the wild veggie burgers through the forest]

C. [the wild veggie burgers]

D. [through the forest]

E. [veggie burgers through the forest]

---


## Constituency Testing

---

### Constituency Testing

Using grammatical tests and manipulations to determine whether something is a valid constituent

- "Can a syntactic operation apply to this chunk?"

---

### Three Main Constituency Tests we'll use

- Substitution

- Standalone answers

- Movement

---

## Constituency Test #1: Substitution

- Can you replace that element of the sentence with a placeholder?

- Any time you can replace a chunk of sentence with something else, it's a constituent

---

### Good substitution testing words

- Wh-words (who, what, where, when, how, why)

	- She never climbed [the tallest mountain in Africa] [in 2018].
	
- Pronouns (he, it, her, them, they, that)

	- [Your instructor Will] has no desire to meet [the director of those awful modern transformers movies]
	
- Adverbs of Place and Time (then, there)

	- I grew up [just south of Denver, Colorado in a boring suburb near a reservoir]
	
- "Do so"

	- Jessica [ordered fried ice cream at the restaurant], and I [did so] too.

---

### The indignant kitten eyed my veggie burger with disgust yesterday at dinner

- **He** eyed **it**

- The indignant kitten **did so**.

- The indignant kitten eyed **what** with digust **when**?

- The kitten eyed my veggie burger **how** yesterday at dinner?

- The **obligate carnivore** eyed my **dinner** with disgust **then**

- *There are other chunks we can't isolate like this*

	- [The indignant kitten eyed my]

---


### Your intrepid and syntax-loving TA saw the Great Horned Owl that Will had mentioned in passing while they were standing in the hallway last week before class last night shortly before leaving campus to go to Red Robin to nerd out about trees and eat french fries.

- **She** saw **it** **then**.

- **She** saw the Great Horned Owl that Will had mentioned **then** shortly before **that**.

- (... and many more)

---

### If you can replace something with a placeholder, it's a constituent

- ... and if you are unable to, it's not a constituent!

---

## Constituency Test #2: Standalone Answers

- A string of words that can be the answer to a WH question is a constituent

---

### Robert the Enchiladaholic thoughtlessly purchased a $1000 gift card to Chiquita's Mexican Restaurant last week.

- "Who bought the gift card?"

- "What did he buy?"

- "Where was the gift card to?"

- "When did he buy it?"

- "What did Robert do?"

- "How did he buy it?"

---

### If a chunk can serve as the standalone answer to a question, it's a constituent

- "What can a chunk that's a constitutent do?"

---

## Constituency Test 3: Moving items together

- If you can move a string of words together, they're a constituent

	- The resulting sentence needs to be grammatical
	
	- Try Trolls Nice!

---

### Eugene sold his watch collection to the Pine Thugs

- His watch collection is what Eugene sold to the Pine Thugs.

- To the Pine Thugs, Eugene's watch collection was sold.

- Sold his watch collection to the Pine Thugs, Eugene did.

- Pine thugs are who Eugene sold his watch collection to.

---

### If you can move a chunk together, it's a constituent

---

### So, that's how we evaluate constituency

- Let's test it out

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### Which is *not* a constituent in "Michael and Karla founded an innovative new dermatology company last month"?

a. [Michael and Karla]

b. [founded an innovative new dermatology company]

c. [an innovative new dermatology company]

d. [an innovative new]

e. [last month]

---

### Which is *not* a constituent in "Michael and Karla founded an innovative new dermatology company last month"?

a. [Michael and Karla]

b. [founded an innovative new dermatology company]

c. [an innovative new dermatology company]

d. <correct>[an innovative new]</correct>

e. [last month]

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### Which is *not* a constituent in "Lil' Bub won every cat show in Indiana."?

a. [every cat show in Indiana]

b. [Lil' Bub]

c. [Bub won every]

d. [every cat show]

e. [cat show]

---

### Which is *not* a constituent in "Lil' Bub won every cat show in Indiana."?

a. [every cat show in Indiana]

b. [Lil' Bub]

c. <correct>[Bub won every]</correct>

d. [every cat show]

e. [cat show]

---

### What do we call these constituents?

- We name them after the *head* of the phrase

---

### The angry squirrel stole the mixed nuts from Walmart

- [The angry squirrel] - **'Noun Phrase' (NP)**, headed by a noun

- [stole the mixed nuts from Walmart] - **'Verb Phrase' (VP)**, headed by a verb

- [from Walmart] - **'Prepositional Phrase' (PP)**, headed by a preposition.

- [The angry squirrel stole the mixed nuts from Walmart] - The **Sentence (S)**

---

### ... and then we label individual words with their lexical types

- Nouns (N), Verbs (V), Prepositions (P), Determiners (DET), 

---

### Constituency is *really* important

- We seem to 'understand' it as language speakers

- Syntactic rules make constant reference to constituents

- We're pretty sure that whatever syntax is in the mind, constituency is a part of it

	- So, thinking about constituency is going to be constant
	
---

"OK, OK. We get it. Constituency is a thing."

- ### ... but where the heck does it come from?!

---

### Language is hierarchical

- Words combine into phrases/constituents

- Phrases combine to form bigger phrases.

- Phrases combine to form sentences.

- Phrase structure rules show how words/phrases combine to form larger phrases/sentences.

---

### We can't treat sentences as 'flat' and find constituency

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_angrysquirrelflat.jpg">

---

### But if we think about it hierarchically...

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_angrysquirrel.jpg">

- ### BOOM!  Constituency.

---

### We need to go deeper...

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_angrysquirrelfull.jpg">

---

### Syntax Trees

A representation of the hierarchical structure of sentences, capturing constituency.

---

### I ate.

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_iate.jpg">


---

### I see you.

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_iseeyou.jpg">

### The dog chased the cat

---

### I saw the big, sweet dogs from La Jolla with fleas

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_dogs_long.jpg">

---

### Trees express syntactic structure independent of specific words

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_dogchased.jpg">

---
### Trees express syntactic structure independent of specific words

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_dogchased_alt.jpg">

---

## Constituency is important for meaning!

---

### "We need more honest politicians"

- "We need **more politicians** who are honest"

- "We need to exchange our policitians with ones who are **more honest**"

---

### There are two ways to break the sentence up

- We need [more honest] politicians

- We need more [honest politicians]

- The meaning changes based on how you break the sentence up

---

### Different structures can imply different meanings

---

### I [saw the man] [with the telescope]

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_manwithtelescope1.jpg">

---

### I saw [the man with the telescope]

### The bear ate the hiker with ketchup

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/nps_hikeingroups.jpg">

---

### John slapped his friend with the smelly fish

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_slappedwithfish2.jpg">

---

### <danger>There are hundreds of ways to draw a syntax tree</danger>

- If you just google "Syntax Tree Drawing", you'll find many theories intermixed

- The best approach is a subject of *huge* theoretical debate

	- We're teaching you a small sub-set that's pretty uncontroversial

- You will not find much consistency on the internet

	- You can leave some things off, specify things more or less...
	
- **Use the materials we're providing you with, please!**

---

### Wrapping up

- We know that languages can use word order to code grammatical relations

- We know that there's more to it than ordering

- We know that constituents of sentences are a thing

- ... and that they're derived from hierarchy in sentences

- We can read tree diagrams to understand the nature of that hierarchy

---

### Next time

- We'll learn how to create syntax trees!

- ... and we'll talk about the rules that govern that process

# Syntax 2: Phrase Structure Rules

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---
			  
### Today's Plan

- Phrase Structure Rules

- Tree Planting

---

### Last time, we talked about constituents

- Noun Phrases

- Verb Phrases

- Prepositional Phrases

---

### ... and we realized that the world of syntax isn't flat

- (Neither is the rest of the world, damnit)

---

### Now, let's think a bit more about those structures

---

# Phrase Structure Rules

---

### We have intuitions about what can be inside a noun phrase in English...

- The big, strong rhinoceros

- &#42;The big, quickly rhinoceros

- &#42;The strong, charged rhinoceros

---

### Same thing with a prepositional phrase in English

- I saw her outside the barn

- &#42;I saw her outside fall over

- &#42;I saw her outside beautiful

---

### Even a verb phrase has constraints in English

- I hugged the small kitten

- &#42;I small hugged the kitten

- &#42;I hugged gently the kitten (???)

---

### And sentences definitely have rules in English

- Sam sent Amanda to the store.

- &#42;Sent Sam Amanda to the store.

- &#42;Amanda Sam to the store sent.

---

### Unless Yoda you are

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/yoda.jpg">

---

### So, English has rules about how phrases are built

- ... that sounds useful!

---

### A good theory of syntax does two things

- 1: It can generate all of the sentences that speakers of a language think are grammatical

- 2: It will *not* generate sentences that speakers of a language think are *ungrammatical*

---

### Today, we'll talk about a *very* basic approach to this

---

# <danger>HUGE DISCLAIMER</danger>

- Syntax is **huge**

- We are only teaching you a small part of it to handle a small number of sentences.

	- The rules you will have do *not* suffice for most complex sentences

- The handout shows the rules *we will use*.

	- There are other sets. Trust nobody else, not even the book!

- I'm going to be saying "Don't worry about that" a lot this quarter!

- Consider LIGN 101 syntax to be a teaser for LIGN 121, where you'll get a bigger picture

	- ... and a different set of rules!

---

### Phrase Structure Rules

- Rules that describe the sub-elements which can form a given syntactic constituent

	- ... and their ordering

- We're going to talk in terms of "building trees"

	- But really, we're building sentences

- **Syntax trees are built from phrase structure rules!**

---

### Phrase structure rule format

- X &rarr; Y Z

- S &rarr; NP VP

	 - "A sentence is composed of an NP, followed by a VP"
   
<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_snpvp.jpg">

---

### Phrase structure rules are like building blocks of sentences

- We build sentences by building chunks using PS rules

	- Then combining them into the desired larger forms

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/tangrams.jpg">

---

### A Note on Notation

- We're going to talk about NP, N', and N

	- These are three different things
	
- NP (/ɛn pi/ or "Noun Phrase")

- N' or N̄ ("N-Bar", /ɛn bɑɹ/)

	- N' and N̄ are two ways of writing the same thing
	
- N ("Noun", /ɛn/)

- The symbols &rarr; and -> mean the same thing

---

# How do we build trees?

---

### Building a phrase structure tree (Part 1)

- Step 1: Find constituents and think about what *kinds* of phrases they are

	- "Huh, this is a preposition. There's gotta be a PP around here..."

- Step 2: Start from S and move down the tree, stitching together according to our PS rules

	- Some folks work *up*, starting from individual phrases

	- ***The top node is always S***

---

### Building a phrase structure tree (Part 2)

- Step 3: Check to make sure every branching obeys the phrase structure rules

	- "OK, this is Rule 9, now rule 1 to 2, then here's 11..."

- Step 4: A beautiful tree will be grown!

---

### Some tree-drawing rules

- You always branch downwards

	- If a branch is moving upwards, you're doing it wrong

- Lines should *never* cross

	- They don't need to. If you think they need to, you're doing it wrong.
	
- You will not need to do any three-way branching for LIGN 101

	- Every branch will have either one or two connections down.

- Some branches may have two words (but not on your homeworks!)

	- Compounds or phrases without internal structure "Mai Tai" or "Will Styler" or "back up"

- <danger>Use the Phrase Structure Rules we gave you on the handout.</danger>

## Where you attach things changes the meaning!

### Be careful where you put your prepositional phrases!

- There are multiple 'legal' places to attach a given prepositional phrase

- ... but where you attach prepositional phrases changes the meaning

## Drawing Trees

---
### How do you draw phrase structure trees?

- **Only Electronically!**

	- This makes for fewer scanning and legibility issues

- Pros tend to use LaTeX, but that's fancy

- Or using a tool like <http://ironcreek.net/phpsyntaxtree/> 

	- You'll need to use bracket notation for that
	
	- It's frustrating at first, but it does the job
	
- This is a friendly tool <https://groverburger.github.io/sapling/>

### "The grumpy polar bears from LA hated the excruciating traffic on the 405."

Let's break it down!

---

### The grumpy polar bears

* Rule 1 -> Rule 4 -> Rule 4 -> Rule 3

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbears1.jpg">

---

### From LA

* Rule 6 -> Rule 2 -> Rule 3

---

### The grumpy polar bears from LA

* Combine the PP and NP using Rule 5

---

---


### The excruciating traffic

* Rules 1, 4, 3

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbears4.jpg">

---


### On the 405

* Rule 6 -> Rule 1 -> Rule 3

---
<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbears5.jpg">

---

### The excruciating traffic on the 405

* Rule 5 to combine the two chunks

---
<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbears6.jpg">

---

### hated the excruciating traffic on the 405

* A little bit of Rule 9's all I need

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbears7.jpg">

---

### "The grumpy polar bears from LA hated the excruciating traffic on the 405."

- Rule 7, then BOOM!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_polarbearsfull.jpg">

---

### For Next Time

- We'll do a bit more tree practice


- We'll touch on some of the many things we're leaving behind in Syntax

Spoiler alert.

---

### The prescriptivist English Professor glared at the rebellious linguist

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_engprof.jpg">

---

### OK, OK, enough with the trees!

- Yeah, I know.

---

### This is the problem with LIGN 101

- There's too much awesomeness to Syntax for me to cover in three classes

- We need to focus on what's crucial
 	
 	- (You all understanding syntactic hierarchy)

- ... over what's awesome

 	- Cross-linguistic patterns and advanced syntactic questions

---

### ... and a whole lot has been dismissed as "Here there be dragons"

---

# Introducing some Dragons

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/smaug.jpg">

---

## English Syntax is *way* more complicated

---

### We're looking at relatively simple sentences

- (It may not feel that way, but we are!)

---

### "Truly, my dismay that three dragons were slain by the fame-craving knight couldn't be greater."

- Your phrase structure rules will shatter against such pain.

---

### "Robert who came last weekend when you threw that party where Marvin saw Bob is kind of a jerk."

- That's right, that's two S's inside an NP

---

### Also, sentences will do weird things

- Weird things will be done by sentences.

- Weird things will be the things that sentences do.

- What will sentences do?

- Will sentences do weird things?

---

### Passive Voice

- Miguel threw Rajesh the ball.

- Rajesh was thrown the ball.

- **Passive voice turns the object of a sentence into the subject**

---

### This is a 200 foot pole

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/long_pole.jpg">

- The passive voice will not be touched with it

---

### This makes us think about 'movement' and 'transformation'

- Phrase structure rules don't account for changes

---

### Jessica can buy Cheerios

- Can Jessica buy Cheerios?

- It was Jessica who bought the Cheerios

- Cheerios are what Jessica bought

- Who can buy Cheerios?

- What can Jessica buy?

- Jessica can buy what?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/jessica_buy_what.jpg">

(Thanks Jaron from W22!)

---

### The movement... it's everywhere

- Your book gets a bit deeper into this than we have time to

- ... but it's cooooooool.

---

## Here's a fun dragon

---

### Garden Path Sentences

Sentences which are easy to incorrectly parse at first

---

### Example Garden Paths

- The old man the boat.

- The complex houses married soldiers and their families.

- The girl told the story cried.

- The man who whistles tunes pianos.

- The war on plastic faces setback as cost of recycled material soars

	- This is from [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/13/war-on-plastic-waste-faces-setback-as-cost-of-recycled-material-soars), and was fixed with 'plastic waste' after publication

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/horseraced_harley.jpg">

---

### These occur in human language

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/gardenpath_dog.jpg">

---

## Let's look at some other sentences

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### A is 'Perfectly Grammatical', E is 'Completely Ungrammatical'

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

## More three dogs bit than eight humans.

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

## More cats are on my bed than I can cuddle them.

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

## More sales are expected this year relative to last year.

## More people have been to Russia than I have.

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

## More politicians self-finance their campaigns in the USA than elsewhere.

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

## More undergrads text their friends during the week than I text my friends.

---

### Wait a second...

- More people have been to Russia than I have.

- More undergrads text their friends during the week than I text my friends.

- **What do these actually mean?!?**

---

### These are called 'Comparative Illusions'

- ... and they show that we can have instincts which make something 'seem' grammatical and sensical which actually isn't!

- The factors which make these feel more or less acceptable are a subject of syntactic research

- They can even happen in natural speech

	- 'I think there are more candidates on stage who speak Spanish more fluently than our president speaks English.' - [Dan Rather](https://twitter.com/danrather/status/1144076809182408704?lang=en)

---

### How about some center embedding gore?

---

> An apparently new speech disorder a linguistics department our correspondent visited was affected by has appeared.

- An apparently new speech disorder
- a linguistics department
- our correspondent 
- visited
- was affected by
- has appeared.

---

> The cause experts the LSA sent investigate remains elusive.

- The cause 
- experts 
- the LSA 
- sent 
- investigate
- remains elusive.

---

> Physicians neurologists psychologists other linguists called for help called for help called for help didn’t help either. 

- Physicians 
- neurologists 
- psychologists 
- other linguists 
- called for help 
- called for help 
- called for help 
- didn’t help either. 

---

> The patient the nurse the doctor consulted was sick.

- The patient 
- the nurse 
- the doctor 
- consulted 
- was sick.
- <danger>wtf?!?!</danger>

---

### Thanks to Emily for some of these syntactic troubles

- Also here's the center embedding [source](https://specgram.com/CLI.2/03.bakery.disorder.html)

---

### Modifier Scope issues

- “Crispy Ahi Tuna Tacos”

	- Crispy tuna, or Crispy Tacos


---

## There are other approaches to Syntax too!

---

### V', S', IP, and more!

- There are many theories and approaches, each with pros and cons

- This is the case in anything in Linguistics, but especially here!

---

## Other Languages exist!

---

### Different languages do sentences differently

- Not all languages put the Subject (do-er) before the verb, which is followed by the object (which is being affected) ('SVO')

- Lakota is SOV, with postpositions

- ASL is OSV

- Spanish adjectives are after the noun

- Russian can move the arguments around to help make your point

---

### Phrase structure rules are language specific, too!

- We'll play with other languages' phrase structure rules in this class!

---

### We're just trying to get you understanding the basics

- What syntax is

- How sentences are composed hierarchically

- ... and how grammar works for sentences

---

### For everything else, LIGN 121

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/plug.jpg">

---

## One last oddity

---
  
### Our rules can act weirdly

Rule 8: VP -> V

Rule 9: VP -> V NP

---

### To sleep

* VP -> V: Will slept

* VP -> V NP: Will slept Jessica

---

### To dream

* VP -> V: Will dreamed

* VP -> V NP: Will dreamed Jessica

---

### To walk

* VP -> V: Will walked

* VP -> V NP: Will walked Jessica

---

### These are called 'Intransitive verbs'

Verbs that only take a single argument, the 'subject'
  
---

### To hug

* VP -> V NP: Will hugged Jessica

* VP -> V: Will hugged

---

### To move

* VP -> V: Will moved

* VP -> V NP: Will moved Jessica

---

### To see

* VP -> V: Will saw

* VP -> V NP: Will saw Jessica

---

### These are called 'Transitive verbs'

Verbs that can take two arguments, a subject and an object

---

### To bake

* VP -> V: Will baked

* VP -> V NP: Will baked a cake

* VP -> V NP NP: Will baked Jessica a cake

* VP -> V NP NP: ?Will baked a cake Jessica

---

### To find

* VP -> V: Will found.

* VP -> V NP: Will found a cake

* VP -> V NP NP: Will found Jessica a cake

* VP -> V NP NP: ?Will found a cake Jessica

* VP -> V NP NP: Will found a cake some candles

---

### Ditransitive Constructions

Verbs that take a Subject and two objects

---

### To see

* VP -> V: ?Will saw

* VP -> V NP: Will saw a cake

* VP -> V NP NP: ?Will saw Jessica a cake

* VP -> V NP NP: &#42;Will saw a cake Jessica

---

## Whoa!!

- That was a phrase structure rule with three branches!

- That happens sometimes, although there are usually other ways!

---

### To make

* VP -> V: Will made

* VP -> V NP: Will made a judge

* VP -> V NP NP: Will made Jessica a judge

* VP -> V NP NP: Will made a judge Jessica

---

### To make, continued

* VP -> V NP: Will made a judge (with his modelling clay)

* VP -> V NP NP: Will made Jessica a robot

* VP -> V NP NP: Will made a robot, Jessica

---

### Are you vibing me?

- "I'm vibing."

- "I'm vibing you."

- "I'm vibing with this new album"

- "I'm vibing this new album"

- "I'm vibing her a new album"

---

### Wait a second...

- Our phrase structure rules don't universally apply

	- A valid phrase structure rule for one verb might not work for another
	
- ... and it seems to be *lexically specific*

	- It depends on the particular word
	
- ## Is there no hope?!

### It's time to start thinking about what it all means

- Quite literally.

---

## Semantics

The study of meaning in Language

---

## Pragmatics

The study of meaning in conversational context

---

### We're going to spend some time with both of these

- Today, we'll focus on meaning in a greater sense

- Next time, word meanings

- After that, we'll talk about Pragmatics

---
			  
### Today's Plan
	
- Truth in Sentences

- Ambiguity

- Entailment

- Connotation and Denotation

- Prototypes

---

# Truth in sentences

---

### Sentences can be true, or false, with reference to the world

- Since words have meanings, and those meanings can be defined logically...

- We can evaluate the logical truth of a sentence.

---

### Sometimes, it's easy

---

### Tautology

- All linguists are linguists.

- Every bachelor is unmarried.

- A circle is circular.

- The long cat is long.

- *All tautologies are true!*

---

### Contradictions

- A circle is triangular.

- French people are not French.

- Will is tall and short.

- *All contradictions are false!*

---

### Meaningless sentences

- "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously"

- *Meaningless sentences lack meaning!*

---

### Non-Statement Sentences

- **Commands:** Turn in your homework!

- **Questions:** Have you turned in your homework?

- **Greetings:** Welcome to UC San Diego!

- *These can't be evaluated as they're not making claims*

---

### Speech Acts / Performative Language

- I sentence you to three weeks of probation.

- I now pronounce you married.

- *More on these in Pragmatics!*

---

## Declarative sentences can thus be shown to be true or false.

---

### "Will waved"

- There is a set of people who waved.

- If Will is in that set, this sentence is true.

- If Will is not, this sentence is false.

---

### Compositional Semantics

- Syntactic structure, coupled with understanding of meaning of individual phrases, allows the determination of meaning via rules.

- This is *really* cool stuff.

---

### For compositional semantics, LIGN 130 and LIGN 230

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/plug.jpg">

---

### Sometimes, it's hard to figure out what the meaning is

---

# Ambiguity

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/ambiguity.jpg">

---

### Three kinds of Ambiguity

- Syntactic/Structural Ambiguity

- Lexical Ambiguity

- Semantic Ambiguity

---

## Structural/Syntactic Ambiguity

- "I'm not sure what syntactic structure you're going for there"

---

### "I saw the man with the telescope"

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_manwithtelescope1.jpg">

---

### "I saw the man with the telescope"

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_manwithtelescope2.jpg">

---

### "I saw the Queen of England's Hat"
- Note, this requires two new rules, N' -> N' PP and DET -> NP POSS

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_queenenglandshat1.jpg">

---

### "I saw the Queen of England's Hat"

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_queenenglandshat2.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/binladen_mask.jpg">

---


## Lexical Ambiguity

- "I'm not sure what sense of the word you're using"

---

### Word Sense

- The same sequence of phonemes can have multiple meanings

	- This is known as 'polysemy'

- The "sense" is the particular meaning in use at a moment.

- "Spam", "Lit", "Broke", "Turn", "Lemon"

---

### Lexically Ambiguous Sentences

- "He sold her a lemon"

	- A bad car, or a citrus fruit.

- "Stop sending me spam"

	- Spiced ham, or commercial email

- "Will cut up the center of the paper"

---

<img class="wide" src="humorimg/huge_metal_fan.jpg">

---
  
<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/go_long.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/beeftonight.jpg">
  
---

## Semantic Ambiguity

"I know the structure, and I know the senses, but there are multiple readings"

---

### "John kissed his wife, and so did Alex"

- Two people kissing two wives, or one wife kissing two people?

- "John kissed Amy, and so did Alex" is not ambiguous

- "John kissed his wife, and Alex kissed his own wife"

---

### "Bob and Joe are married."

- "Bob and Joe are married to each other"

- "Bob and Joe are married, but Sean, Mike, and Adam are single"

---

### "Every student hates a professor."

- "Every student hates at least one professor that they've had, whoever that may be."

- "Every student hates one professor, and his name is Will Styler"

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/ambiguity_throwthemout.jpg">

---

### There are other types of ambiguity, but these are the three you'll want to know

- Lexical Ambiguity

	- "I can't figure out **what word sense** is being used."

- Syntactic Ambiguity

	- "I can't figure out **which syntactic structure** is intended."

- Semantic Ambiguity

	- "I can't figure out **which of several interpretations** you intend without more context."

B) Syntactic Ambiguity

---

### So, that's when meaning isn't clear.

- Let's talk about the opposite!

---

# Entailment

---

## Entailment

When the use of a word involves logical and necessary conclusions which can be drawn

- "If X is true, then necessarily, Y is true"

- You cannot imagine a situation in which X being true does not make Y true

---

### Sam broke the red toy and the blue toy.

**Entails...**

- The red toy is broken

- The blue toy is broken

- Sam broke two toys.

- Sam is capable of breaking toys.

---

### Sam broke the red toy and the blue toy.

**Does not entail...**

- Sam intentionally broke the toys

- Sam broke the red toy first.

- Sam likes breaking toys.

- They were Sam's toys

---

### Mary passionately kissed Blake

**Entails...**

- Mary kissed Blake

- Blake was kissed by Mary.

- Blake was kissed.

- Mary touched Blake with her lips.

---

### Mary passionately kissed Blake

**Does not entail...**

- Mary loves Blake.

- Mary married Blake.

- Blake kissed Mary.

- Mary kissed Blake many times.

- Mary did *not* kiss Blake.

---

### X entails Y does not mean that Y entails X!

- "Mary passionately kissed Blake" entails "Mary kissed Blake"

- "Mary kissed Blake" **does not** entail "Mary passionately kissed Blake".

	- Mary could have offered a reluctant and chaste peck on the cheek

---

### Entailment *does not* depend on conversational context or situations

- "John left the room" **does not** entail that the room is empty afterwards.

	- "Mary and John were in the room. John left the room"

	- "John was alone in the room. John left the room."

- Entailment is true **only** if you cannot imagine a situation where it could be false.

	- "Mary kissed Blake" can never not entail that Blake was kissed by Mary.
	
- If it depends on context, it's *implicature*.

A) Carlos was hit with a rubber chicken.

B) Roberta had a Rubber Chicken

C) Roberta dislikes Carlos

A) Demetrius was within line-of-sight of the kid

B) Demetrius saw a child.

C) Demetrius was on the street.

D) The kid was walking.

---

### "Demetrius saw the kid who was walking down the street".  Which of the following *is* entailed by this sentence?

A) Demetrius was within line-of-sight of the kid

B) Demetrius saw a child.

C) Demetrius was on the street.

D) <correct>The kid was walking.</correct>

E) Demetrius was older than the kid.

---

### Making assumptions when evaluating entailment is baaaaaaaaad

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/kidgoat.jpg">

---

### Understanding entailment requires you to understand the meaning of words

- "Nathan is a District Attorney" entails that "Nathan is an Attorney"

- "Nathan is a District Attorney" entails that "Nathan is a Lawyer"

- "Nathan is an attorney" **does not** entail that "Nathan is a district attorney"

- "Nathan is an attorney" **does not** entail that "Nathan is a lawyer"

- All of these terms are system specific

	- In a different legal system, the terms might be defined differently

---

### ... and meaning is complicated af

---

# Connotation and Denotation: Shades of Meaning

---

### There are many ways to say the same thing

- Words that 'mean the same thing' are called 'synonyms'

---

### Synonyms

- "Sofa" and "Couch"

- "Pop" and "Soda"

- "Sick" and "Ill"

- "Police Officer" and "Cop"

---

### Synonyms can be tested

- "All sofas are couches, and all couches are sofas"

- "John purchased a car, therefore he bought a car"

- "All sick people are ill, and all ill people are sick"

- "All police officers are cops, and all cops are police officers"

---

### Let's look at another set of words that 'mean the same thing'

- "Cheap" and "Inexpensive"

- "Strong-willed", "Stubborn", and "Pig-Headed"

- "Study" and "Scrutinize"

- "curious" and "nosy"

- "vintage" and "outdated" and "antique"

---

### These words share a *denotation*, but have different *connotations*

- "Cheap" and "inexpensive" both mean "costs little money"

	- ... but it means something different to say "a cheap broom" vs. "an inexpensive broom"

- A person can be "strong-willed", "stubborn" or "pig-headed"

	- ... depending on how angry you are with them at the moment

- "She studied the paper" does not mean the same thing as "She scrutinized the paper"

- Nobody sells outdated clothing, they sell vintage clothing

---

### These differentiate the 'denotation' of a word, from the 'connotation'

- The 'Denotation' is the strict dictionary definition of a word

	- Cheap and Inexpensive both mean "Something that costs little money"
	
- The 'Connotation' describes the non-definitional, emotional and associative facts about how the word is often used.

	- These are often value judgements, or links to related concepts

	- These are facts about usage, more than facts about definition

	- 'Cheap' implies "Not great", inexpensive doesn't.

---

### Strong-Willed, Pig-headed, Stubborn

- **Denotation**: Shows determination not to change one's path or attitude, despite arguments otherwise

- Strong-Willed Connotation?

- Pig-Headed Connotation?

- Stubborn Connotation?

---

### Let's try some sets

- New, Novel, Contemporary, Up-To-Date, State-of-the-Art, Recent

- Aggressive, Assertive, Domineering, Dynamic, Forceful, Pushy

- Offended, insulted, outraged, butthurt, upset

---

### Some words have connotations that associate them with specific contexts

- "inner city" has a specific racial connotation in general use

	- "I live in Central Park West in NYC, inner city life isn't for everybody"

- "Lib" has a specific political connotation in general use

	- "Bernie Sanders is a well known lib politician"

---

### Sometimes, we take steps to avoid a negative connotation

---

## Euphemism

An indirect and "pretty" way to refer to something unpleasant or embarrassing or with a negative connotation

---

### Sample Euphemisms

- "We neutralized three combatants" rather than "We killed three enemy fighters"

- "We expect another round of downsizing" rather than "You all are gonna get fired".

- "Could you point me to the powder room?" rather than "I have to defecate immediately."

- "The children were placed in a [tender-age shelter](https://apnews.com/dc0c9a5134d14862ba7c7ad9a811160e)" rather than "We stuck the children in a detention camp".

	- This was the [ADS Word of the Year](https://www.americandialect.org/tender-age-shelter-is-2018-american-dialect-society-word-of-the-year) for 2018

---

### Connotations aren't universally shared!

- The same word may have different connotations among different groups

	- What's offensive to one group of people might be the neutral term to another
	
	- 'We prefer the term...'

- People may not be aware of the connotations of words they're using

	- 'We've decided not to have kids' vs. 'We're childfree'
	
- ... and most importantly...

---

### Connotations can change over time

- Imbecile, Idiot, Slow, Retarded, Mentally Handicapped, Developmentally Disabled

- This phenomenon (euphemisms turning into negative terms then being replaced) is called the "Euphemism Treadmill"

---

### Torture your local millenials and Gen-Xers

- "Oh, I always wondered what the internet was like in the late 1900s"

- "The world of cell phones was very different at the turn of the century"

- "Instructors used overhead projectors as late as last century"

---

### Connotations can do a *lot* of work

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/butt_dial_booty_call.jpg">

---

### The lines here are blurry

- "Butt dial" and "Booty call" may be two different compounds.

	- Booty text? Butt Text?
	
	- Or are they Adjective+Noun pairs?
	
- Does "thin" mean the same thing as "gaunt"?

- When does "idiot" stop meaning "intellectually disabled person" and start meaning "stupid person"?

- **It's hard to figure out which of many word options carries the best choice of meaning**

---

### This can lead to Semantic Change

- Where words start with one meaning and develop a new one

- This can cause a new word sense, or just an overall change in meaning

- Think 'influencer' or ' mid'

---

... But even single words are a bit hard to define

---

# Semantic Prototype Theory

---

### We have ideas about what words mean

- "Bird"

- "Chair"

---

### We also have strong intuitions about whether a word describes an object or not.

- ... but these intuitions are not binary ("yes" vs. "no")

---

### Let's test this!

---

### What is a bird?

---

---

### A 'Prototype'

An example of a given word or meaning which is "central" to the category, a "better example" of the idea.

---

### This captures a number of intuitions

- The Pope is pretty far from the prototype for "Bachelor"

- An emu is pretty far from the prototype for "Bird"

- A stack of pizza boxes is pretty far from the prototype for "Chair"

---

---

### So, even within a word, meaning can be a bit gradient

- ... and a single word can refer variably to many things

---

### Wrapping Up

- Meaning is complicated

- We can determine meaning using fancy semantic footwork

- We can tell when meaning is unclear or ambiguous

- We can tell when one sentence entails another

- There's more to a word than the dictionary definition

- ... and even definitions can feel pretty gradient

---

## Next time

- We'll focus on individual word meanings

- And we'll start talking about meaning in context

- Bring meaning

# Semantics and Pragmatics: Words in Worlds

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---

### Last time, we talked about meaning, more broadly

- Truth in sentences

- Ambiguity

- Entailment
	
- "Shades of meaning"

	- Connotation vs. Denotation

	- Gradient meaning

---

### Today, we're going to drill into words a bit more, then talk about conversation

---

### Today's Plan

- Word Meaning Relationships

- Word Sense

- Lexical Semantics

- Pragmatics and the Cooperative Principle

---

# Word Meaning Relationships

---

### Words have meanings

- Different words have related meanings

- ... and we find it helpful to talk about those relationships by classifying them

---

### Word Relationships in 101

- Synonym/Antonym

- Homonym/Homophone

- Hyponym/Hypernym

- Metonymy

---

## Synonym

A words which shares the same denotational meaning, but with different spoken form

- e.g. Cop/Police Officer, Sick/Ill, Sofa/Couch

- The usage may be slightly different, but they 'mean' the same thing

---

### "Opportunity Drawing"

- UCSD bans raffles

- They are legally complicated under California law

- Instead, we have "opportunity drawings"

- 🤦🏻‍♂️

---

## Antonym

A word which has a (nearly) opposite denotational meaning

- e.g. sick/healthy, happy/sad, dead/alive, do/undo

- "exactly" opposite is hard, but nearly opposite is fine

---

### Let's find some antonyms

- Always

- Coming

- From

- Take

- Me

- Down

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/evil_santana.jpg">

---

## Hyponym/Hypernym

- A word which is a specific instance of a broader class

	- e.g. Poodle/Dog, Laptop/Computer, iPad/Tablet, Skyscraper/Building

- The greater class is a "hypernym"

- "X is a type of Y": X are hyponyms, Y is the hypernym

---

## Metonymy

When word X, related to word Y, is used to represent the same meaning as Y.

- Beijing has rejected the offer (Beijing == Chinese Gov't)

- We speak several tongues in this classroom (Tongue == Language)

D) The Dean in "We'll have to see if the Dean approves"

E) <correct>Geisel in "Provided that Geisel agrees, we'll finalize the new library policy next week"</correct>

---

## Homonym

A word which shares the same spoken and written form, but has a different meaning

- e.g. Bank (river)/Bank (institution), Mug (coffee)/Mug (street robbery), Phone (iPhone)/Phone ([t] or [ŋ])

- **Homonyms are words which are spelled the same and sound the same but have different senses**

---

## Homophone

A word which shares the same spoken form, but has a different meaning *and is spelled differently*

- Homonym is a Hyponym of Homophone.

- e.g. they're/there, but/butt, banned/band, to/too

---

## The 'Same words' can have different meanings

- The fact that one word can have many meanings is called **polysemy**

---

### Polysemy is a BIG problem

- Roger busted the bank.

	- Is Roger a toddler with a piggy-bank, or an agent with the SEC?

- The fireplace was lit.

	- Best fireplace ever!

---

# Polysemy

---

### Word Sense

The specific meaning of a word being used in a given situation

---

### Many words have multiple senses

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/rock_medusa.jpg">

---

### Fit

- She fit the package into the over-full trunk

- She's fit to work on your project, given her background

- She's having fits about the new deadline

- She's quite fit for her age

- That fit nicely into my schedule

- She fits in well in San Diego

---

### Hit

- I hit the dragon with an arrow

- SchwaCo stock hit $500 a share

- Jiaqi loves to hit the golf course on Fridays

- The mafia hit stunned the local government

- The fingerprints had three hits on old records

- I hit on the dragon at the sleazy bar

- I hit up the dragon for some gold until payday

---

### Oh no.

---

### Verbs use different phrase structures

- We talked about how some verbs don't take an object

	- "I dreamed"

- Some verbs take an object always

	- "I hit the dragon"

- Some verbs take two objects

	- "I baked Jessica a cake"

- **Different verbs demand different arguments**

---

## Argument

Some element of a sentence which helps complete the principal meaning of the sentence.

- **Will** hit **the dragon**

- **Xinyao** baked **Riyam** **a cake**

- **Maria** fired **six rounds**.

---

### It gets worse...

---

### Different verb *senses* demand different arguments

---

### Hit (strike)

"I hit the dragon with an arrow"

- Thing doing the hitting

- Thing being hit

- How the hitting is done (manner, or instrument)

---

### Hit (a value)

"SchwaCo stock hit $500 a share"

- Thing hitting the level/goal/landmark

- The level/goal/landmark

- *No instrument argument is possible*

	- *"SchwaCo stock hit $500 a share with a good economy"

---

### Hit (go to activity)

"Jiaqi loves to hit the bowling alley with his friends"

- Person going to the activity (animate)

- Activity

- *Doesn't take an inanimate subject or an instrument*

	- *"The ball hit the links on weekends"
	
	- *"Andy loves hitting the ballfield with his bat"

---

### Hit on (make sexual advances)

"Sherry hit on Steve at the party"

- Person making the advances

- Person hit on

- *No instrument is permissible*

	- ?"Oishani hit on Jorge with a bad joke"
	
---

### Hit up (to request)

"I hit up the dragon for some gold"

- Person making the request

- Request

- Requested from

- *All three arguments are required*

	- "I hit up the dragon" (For?)

	- "I hit up for money" (Who?)
	
	- "Hit up for money" (???)
	
	- Can't be ditransitive (*"I hit up the dragon some gold")
	
---

### We can think of every verb sense as having a "Frame"

- A set of arguments which it expects

- ... which combine to give the overall meaning of the sentence

- This is often called a 'subcategorization frame'

- These are *lexically specific*

- **This information can be seen as a part of the verb's meaning**

---

### Every verb has a frame

- The [PropBank Project](http://verbs.colorado.edu/propbank/) has been working to produce frames for every verb in large chunks of text

- [Here's the list of frames by verb](http://verbs.colorado.edu/propbank/framesets-english-aliases/)

---

### Knowing this frame is *very* useful for processing text

- Different sets of arguments can imply different verb senses

	- "Verb sense disambiguation"

- It helps us understand text better

	- "Uh oh. There's firing going on. It's the business sense. We should figure out who's doing the firing, who's being fired, and where they're being fired from."
	
- It lets us identify **semantic roles**

---

## Semantic Roles

Specific terms for different roles in the sentence

---

### Semantic Roles are tough to define

- Your book gives terms like "Agent", "Source", "Experiencer", "Theme", "Goal", "Instrument"

- Is the subject in "Darnell fit the package in the trunk" really doing the same thing as in "Darnell fits well at UCSD"?

- Is the object in "Andre the Giant threw the ball" really so different than "Andre the Giant threw the wrestler"?

- Should we spend hours discussing the details of semantic role labels?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/nope_bath.jpg">

---

### So, we'll just focus on the fact that each verb has a frame

- Each frame specifies what arguments the verb expects

- ... and that knowledge is very useful for understanding what it all means

---

### We've been talking about meaning in isolation

- "What does this verb mean, *everywhere*?"

- "What is *always* true about the relation between "up" and "down"?"

- "What is *always* true about Y, given X?"

---

### ... but words can mean something different in context

- "Can you see?"

- "I'm open"

- "Take that"

- "I feel you"

---

### When meaning stops being about the word and starts being about the situation, we've entered the land of...

---

# Pragmatics

---

## Pragmatics

The study of meaning in a discourse context

---

### Semantics is abstract

- The semantic meaning of a word doesn't depend on the context.

- The meaning of "fast" doesn't turn into "slow" in a conversation

	- We'll get to sarcasm later.

- Entailment is true *in every possible universe*.

---

### Pragmatics is contextual

- It considers the current conversation

- It assumes things about the current world

- It uses elements of our situation to 'fill in the blanks'

---

### Everything in pragmatics flows from the idea of discourse

- Conversation and linguistic interaction

- We have conversations with goals in mind

	- Social goals
	
	- Practical goals
	
	- Informational goals

- ... and we assume some cooperation

---

### The "Cooperative Principle" helps us accomplish these goals

- "I will try to act in such a way as to help the exchange of information, rather than hinder it"

- This is not a rule in the sense of grammatical rules, but a guiding principle

- It can be broken down into four maxims, developed by H. Paul Grice

---

# Gricean Maxims

---

## The Maxim of Quality

**"Tell the truth and give accurate information"**

- Do not say things you believe to be false

- Do not say things you don't know (or have evidence to believe) to be true

---

## The Maxim of Quantity

**"Give enough information, but not too much"**

- Be as informative as required, but not more so

- It's just as uncooperative to give too much information as to give too little

---

## The Maxim of Relation

**"Give relevant information and only relevant information"**

- Your responses should have *something* to do with the matter under discussion

- This is also called the maxim of 'relevance'

---

## The Maxim of Manner

**"Be as clear as you can be"**

- Don't be obscure when you can avoid it

- Avoid ambiguous words or phrasings

- Avoid unnecessary wordyness

	- Quantity is about too much info, Manner is about too many words for too little info

- Organize your thoughts

---

### Let's test this...

Your Roommate Tasha arrives home, and asks where your other roommate Levon is. You're not sure, but you know Levon left earlier.

---

## The Maxim of Quality

**"Tell the truth and give accurate information"**

Do not say things you believe to be false

Do not say things you don't know (or have evidence to believe) to be true

---

## The Maxim of Quantity

**"Give enough information, but not too much"**

Be as informative as required, but not more so

It's just as uncooperative to give too much information as to give too little

---

## The Maxim of Relation

**"Give relevant information and only relevant information"**

Your responses should have *something* to do with the matter under discussion

---

## The Maxim of Manner

**"Be as clear as you can be"**

Don't be obscure when you can avoid it

Avoid ambiguous words or phrasings

Avoid unnecessary wordyness

Organize your thoughts

---

### The lines can be blurry

- Manner is when the right of information is presented confusingly or badly
	- Quantity is when you've *clearly* given too much or not enough information

- Relation is when you're giving the right amount of information *about something that doesn't matter to the conversation*
	- Quantity is when you're giving too much or too little information about what does matter
	
- The boundaries are fluid, and generally, there are multiple maxims being violated at once!

---


### These maxims affect meaning

- "Kae was alone in the room... or so they believed"

- "Will, who is absolutely not Batman, taught the class."

- "Marvin left at 5:44 and 30 seconds."

- "Did Ramchand ever work with Sam?" "He hates dogs."

- "Did Sarah buy chicken?" "I think so".

---

### We assume people are following these maxims

- It allows us to get a lot more done.

	- Less confirmation, clarification

	- More efficiency

---

### A Non-Gricean Screenplay

Jessica: What'd you get at the store?

- W: Ice Cream, Tootsie Rolls, a Big Squishy Tofurkey, and a receipt

- J: Did you really get a big squishy Tofurkey?

- W: Maybe. I don't think so.

- J: Wait, did you or didn't you?

- W: They didn't have any Kobe beef.

- J: Wait, what does that have to do with it?

- W: Absolutely positively completely and totally nothing at all.

- J: It's divorce time.

- FIN.

### Violating a maxim

- *Actually being uncooperative* by failing to follow these guidelines

- Violating maxims actually messes up conversations

- You will violate these maxims for your Semantics and Pragmatics Homework

	- You're gonna have fun with this.

---

### Maxim Violation in Action

<video controls src="video/randy_savage.mp4"></video>

---

### Wrapping up

- Words have relationships to one-another

- Words expect certain arguments, and those depend on word sense

- We assume people are cooperative in conversation

- ... and the Gricean maxims describe what that usually looks like

---

## Next time

- We'll talk about other elements of pragmatics

- Bring meaning, in context

---

<huge>Thank you!</huge>





## Week 7

$ LIGN 101 - Pragmatics

### Get SET!

- New student evaluations dropped

- It's like CAPE, but designed to reduce bias and improve usefulness for evaluating teaching

---

# Pragmatics: Language in Context

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---

### Last time, we started with the cooperative principle

- "If people are acting cooperatively, we can skip a whole lot of pain"

	- ... and we talked about the maxims that help us define cooperation
	
- Today, we'll talk about some of the things that grow out of that

---

### Today's Plan

- Flouting vs. Violating maxims

- Presupposition

- Conversational Implicature

- Speech acts

- Deixis

- All that we're leaving behind

---

### Grice's Maxims of...

- Quality

- Quantity

- Relevance

- Manner

---

### Violating a maxim

- *Actually being uncooperative* by failing to follow these guidelines

- Violating maxims actually messes up conversations

---

### Flouting a Maxim

- Intentionally violating a maxim *in a way that the listener can detect* to express a specific meaning

- This *carries meaning* in the conversation

- It can have great comedic effect

- Unless it's undetected, the conversation is not messed up at all

---

### Examples of Maxim Flouting

- "Oh, yes, Taco Bell is truly gourmet cuisine" (it is clearly not)

- "Is this going to be on the test?" "That's a good question."

- "How does my hair look?" "We haven't been to a cat show in a while."

- "Should I build syntax trees or work on phonology problems for the exam?"  "Yes"

---

# Presupposition

---

## Presupposition

Those things which are *implicitly assumed* about the discourse, participants, and world more generally

---

### Presupposition Examples

- "Were you there when Will made that bad joke?"

	- Presupposes that Will made a bad joke

- "Do you still eat breadsticks with every meal?"

	- Presupposes that the person ate breadsticks with every meal
	
- "Did you meet the happy linguistics majors?"

	- Presupposes that happy linguistics majors exist
	
	- (Of course they do!)
	
---

### 'How is this different from entailment?!'

- Presuppositions are assumptions made, but which aren't definitionally true

- Presuppositions can be canceled

	- "Did you see Will again in Vons?" "I've never seen him in person before!"
	
- Presuppositions aren't canceled by sentence negation

---

### Entailment is canceled by negation

- "Rebecca had a weird student"
	- Entails that she had a student

- "Rebecca didn't have a weird student"
	- Doesn't entail that she had a student
	
---

### Presupposition survives negation
	
- "Rebecca's student was weird"
	- Presupposes that she has a student

- "Rebecca's student was not weird"
	- Still presupposes that she has a student
	
---

### Let's try some examples

- Will regretted eating the week-old enchiladas

- Jessica forgot to water the plants

- If Lakshmi had come earlier, the party would've been better.

- Rebecca's student was very strange.

- Once it started raining, nobody in San Diego could drive.

- Will threw his remote while lecturing again.

---

### Sentence negation doesn't cancel presuppositions

- Will didn't regret eating the week-old enchiladas

- Jessica didn't forget to water the plants

- If Lakshmi had come earlier, the party wouldn't have been better.

- Once it started raining, everybody in San Diego could drive just fine.

- Will didn't throw his remote while lecturing again, it stayed in his hand.

---

### Weaponized Presuppositions

- *Presuppositions can be made in bad faith, taking as presupposed things that aren't true or agreed upon?*

- "Were you angry when you stole my cookies?"

- "Have you stopped assigning evil homeworks?"

- "Ugh, is your boyfriend being a jerk again?"

- "All the hard work I've done to stop academic integrity violations hasn't been enough, we need to launch cheaters into the sun."

- "You forgot to give your professors a gift for Teacher's Day"

---

### Presuppositions are neat

- They're commonly used (and abused)

- They're different from entailment in that they're true even when negated, and can be canceled.

- And they express truths, not just assumptions

	- Speaking of which...

---

## Conversational Implicature

---

## Conversational Implicature

What is suggested, but not expressed or entailed, by an utterance.

- As a listener, you "draw an implicature" from a statement.

---

### What does "Jelena finally bought a hard drive to back up her computer" entail?

---

### "Jelena finally bought a hard drive to back up her computer" implies that...

- Jelena didn't have one before
	
- She'd needed one for a long time
	
- Her computer wasn't backed up

- Jelena owns a computer

- Jelena used her own money
	
---

### "Jelena finally bought a hard drive to back up her computer" *does not* imply that...

- Jelena is Serbian

- Jelena owns a Mac

- Jelena is a Dean at UCSD

- She went to Costco for the hard drive

- ... everything else

---

### Unlike entailments, implicatures do not need to be true in every situation

---

### "Jelena finally bought a hard drive to back up her computer" implies that...

- Jelena didn't have one before
	
- She'd needed one for a long time
	
- Her computer wasn't backed up

- Jelena owns a computer

- Jelena used her own money
	
---

### Implicatures are possible *because* of the Cooperative Principle and Gricean Maxims

- We can draw implicatures because we think people are cooperating

- We are trying to find a way that the other person's phrasing is in accordance with the maxims

- Behind every implicature is a maxim which would otherwise be violated

---

### "Robert might have eaten the cookie"

- Implies that the speaker is unsure whether Robert ate the cookie.

- If the cookie is known to have been eaten by Robert, this is a Quality violation.

---

### "Bub ate some of the cat treats"

- Implies Bub didn't eat them all

	- This is called a "scalar implicature"

- If she did, this statement is a Quantity violation

---

### "John, who is 100% not a lizard person, is coming to dinner"

- Implies that John might, in fact, be a lizard person

- If he is not, this statement is a Relevance violation

---

### "Who do you think stole the cookie?" "I heard Ruaridh was in town"

- Implies reason to believe that Ruaridh might have stolen the cookie

- If not, this statement is a Relevance violation

---

### "Hey, you, did you write this note?" "No quiero responder a esta pregunta."

- Implies that I don't speak English.

- If I also speak English, this statement is a Manner violation

---

### Common implicatures

- "You're interested in Ron? He cheated on his last girlfriend!"

- "You claim you paid my client in full.  Was this before or after your conviction for armed robbery?"

- "Will I be getting fired?" "We've had to make some really tough decisions."

- "Robert and Jiseung sure have been hanging out a lot"

- "Lots of folks wear deodorant"

- "It's getting late"

---

### Implicature is important

- It's everywhere!

- It can be intentional or unintentional

- They can even be deceptive

---

### Deceptive Implicature

- "Herman's Rice is Gluten Free!"
	- Implies that all other rice isn't

- "You promise me that you didn't eat my cookie?"  
	- "We've been friends for 10 years!"

- "Do you have any overseas bank accounts in which you're storing money?"
	- "Pfft, no, I don't have any secret numbered swiss bank accounts" 
	- In reality, he has several accounts in the Caymans

- "Where were you last night?"
	- "Home"
	- (No mention of the 6 hours during which he was robbing a bank)

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/grice_crispies.png">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/perishable_manager.jpg">

---

### Remember, the cooperative principle implies cooperation!

- So, it doesn't always apply!

- <img class="r-stretch" src="img/interrogation.jpg">
	
---

### Implicature is an important part of Pragmatics

- ... and it stems from the cooperative principle, as well as conversational context

- But there are other elements of conversation which stem from the context as well!

---

# Speech Acts and Performative Speech

---

### Sometimes, a statement is more than just a statement

- Most speech is declarative, interrogative, or serves to expand the discourse

- Asking questions, making statements, and interacting

- Sometimes, talking itself *is the action*

---

## Speech Acts ("Performative Speech")

Sentences which *accomplish actions* by being uttered

---

### Speech act examples

- "I declare you to be married"

- "I sentence you to fifteen hours of community service"

- "I swear that I didn't steal your cookie"

- "I apologize for eating your cookie"

- "I agree to your terms"

- "I formally object to your doing this"

---

### Speech acts are an odd kind of speech

- ... with four important characteristics

---

### Speech acts are always in the present

- "I swore that I didn't steal your cookie" vs. "I swear I didn't..."

- "I apologized for eating the cookie" vs. "I apologize for eating the cookie"

- "I will agree to your terms" isn't "I agree to your terms"

---

### Speech acts are always 1st Person

- "I agree to your terms" vs. "You agree to my terms"

- "She declares you husband and wife"

- "Robert swears he never ate the cookie"

- "We the Jury find the defendant Guilty"

---

### Speech acts always use a subset of performative verbs

- "I walk into the room" isn't a speech act

- "I say you're going to enjoy HW4" isn't a speech act either

- "I brush my teeth" sure isn't.

---

### Speech acts depend on social context

- "I sentence you to 15 hours of community service" requires you to be a judge

- "I declare you married" requires you to be a licensed officiant

- "I apologize for eating your cookie" only works when said to the person whose cookie you stole.

- There are often other rituals involved (e.g. placing your hand on a holy book or object, a hand-shake, a wedding ceremony)

---

### Not all things are speech acts...

<video controls src="video/i_declare_bankruptcy.m4v"></video>

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### Which of the below sentences is a speech act?

A) "We ate ten cookies last night."

B) "I might have eaten ten cookies last night."

C) "I swear to you, I have no idea who ate the cookies."

D) "I formally declared Sooyoung to be a competent researcher."

E) "She sentenced Karla to three weeks of house arrest."

---

### Which of the below sentences is a speech act?

A) "We ate ten cookies last night."

B) "I might have eaten ten cookies last night."

C) <correct>"I swear to you, I have no idea who ate the cookies."</correct>

D) "I formally declared Sooyoung to be a competent researcher."

E) "She sentenced Karla to three weeks of house arrest."

---

### That context dependence is why these land in Pragmatics

- ... and why they're tough to interpret outside of that context

---

### There are other things that depend on context

---

# Deixis

---

### A note on the ground outside: "Meet me here tomorrow at this time"

This note is uninterpretable

- Where's here?

- Who's me?

- When's tomorrow?  At what time?

---

### These are all "deictic" expressions

- They make reference to the discourse context, and don't have meaning outside of it

---

## Deictic Words

Words whose meaning depends on the conversational context

---

### Types of Deictic Words

- Pronouns: Me, Us, Him, Her, It, Them

- Temporal Expressions: Today, Next Month, Now, Then, Soon

- Locatives: Here, there, close, across the street

- Demonstratives: This, That, The other, those

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### Which sentence *does not* contain a deictic word?

A) "Rick and Graham had their wedding there.

B) "I'm not sure who you're talking about."

C) "Mahesh will see to it next week."

D) "Sally took some students out to dinner at a Sushi restaurant."

E) "John saw a coffee shop across the parking lot."

---

### Which sentence *does not* contain a deictic word?

A) "Rick and Graham had their wedding there.

B) "I'm not sure who you're talking about."

C) "Mahesh will see to it next week."

D) <correct>"Sally took some students out to dinner at a Sushi restaurant."</correct>

E) "John saw a coffee shop across the parking lot."

---

### Deictic Expressions need context to be understood

- This is a big problem in natural language processing

- "Jian will meet you here."

- "Ron scheduled her for two weeks out"

- "She'll need to come back for a consult shortly"

- "Mark's parked across the street from there."

---

### Many of these things depend on the past elements of the conversation

- "Jian will take care of it next week"

- "They're gonna have a great time"

- "The cat will win the show for sure"

---

### We've seen this before already

- "the" is the "definite" article

	- Refers to something already defined
	
- "a" is the "indefinite" article

	- Refers to something which hasn't yet been defined
	
---

### Definiteness vs. Indefiniteness

- "Did you go to (a/the) store?"
	
	- "I went to the store" vs. "I went to THE STORE"

- "I saw (a/the) man last week"

- "(A/the) handyman can fix the door"

- "My cat is going to be in (a/the) show"

- We know the referents in part based on discourse!

	- This is called "Anaphora", resolving the referents of different terms

---

### There's plenty more to the "information structure" of discourse

- Which is new information, which is old information?

- Who does what refer to?

- What is being contrasted?

- ... but that's a whole other bag of worms

---

### So, that's Pragmatics

- The idea that the meaning of some things is inseparable from the discourse context

- ... and the final of the major subfields we're going to terribly, TERRIBLY under-describe

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/ignoring_pragmatics.jpg">

---

# The Linguistic Subfields

---

### We've now talked about the "major subfields" of Linguistics

- Phonetics

- Phonology

- Morphology

- Syntax

- Semantics

- Pragmatics

---

### (There are other fields, but we'll get to that later)

---

### We've treated them all as independent

- ... but they're really not

- Let's take a few minutes to watch them mix

---

### Syntax and Phonetics

- **Prosody!** 

- Prosody governs all the elements of speech that aren't vowels or consonants

---

### Incorrect Prosody is a great way to bother people

- "I'm going to the store to get peas, carrots, milk, cat food and cereal"

- "I saw the Duke of Edinburgh speak"

- "Did you see me at Vons?

---

### From T.S Eliot's *The Wasteland*

> What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow<br>
Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,<br>
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only<br>
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,<br>
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,<br>
And the dry stone no sound of water. Only<br>
There is shadow under this red rock,<br>
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),<br>
And I will show you something different from either<br>
Your shadow at morning striding behind you<br>
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;<br>
I will show you fear in a handful of dust.

### "Wow, text to speech is hard.  I wonder why... I should take LIGN 6!"

- <img class="r-stretch" src="img/plug.jpg">

---

### Phonetics and Pragmatics

- Stress for Contrastive Focus

- "No, I saw STEVE last weekend"

- "Tyresha went to the park last weekend"

- "I went to the store"

- "I went to THE STORE"

---

### Morphology and Phonology

- Refrigerate (ɹə'fɹɪdʒɚeɪt)

- Refrigerator (ɹə'fɹɪdʒɚeɪɾɚ)

- Photograph (foʊɾə'gɹæf)

- Photographer (fə'tɑgɹəfɚ)

---

### Syntax and Semantics

- We've been all over that already

- Verb frames, argument structure, etc.

---

### Syntax and Pragmatics

- "I saw John last weekend"

- "It was John that I saw last weekend"

- "John is who I saw last weekend"

- "Last weekend, I saw John"

- "John, I saw last weekend"

- "John?  Saw him last weekend I did."

---

### Plus there are all the fields we haven't talked about yet...

- Language Change/Historical Linguistics

- Sociolinguistics

- Psycholinguistics

- Computational Linguistics

- Neurolinguistics

- Language Acquisition

---

### Every subfield interacts with every other subfield

- These are not actually separate things, but a schema for representing knowledge in the field

- We think about these as regions, but it's hard to draw exact lines

- ... and the lines are different in each language

---

### You need to know all of them

- Linguistics Grad School makes you do some work in every area

- It is a poor linguist who knows only one subfield

- This is an advantage to a LING major, rather than just taking one or two courses
	
---

# You cannot run

- You cannot hide

- Phonetics will find you.

	- (So just learn the damned IPA)
	
---

### I know what you're thinking

- "Will, of course I want to declare a LIGN Major!  What classes should I take!"

---

## Planning for your LING Major!

---

### Learn more about our majors [here](https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/undergrad/majors/index.html)

- General Lingustics

	- "Which subfield do you like?" "Yes"

- Speech and Language Sciences

	- This is how you can aim yourself towards Speech Pathology and Audiology
	
- Cognition and Language

	- Focuses on language and the brain

- Language and Society

	- Focuses on language and social issues

- Language Studies

	- Focus on your language of choice

---

### Our classes are usually offered in the same quarters

- **Fall:** 110 Phonetics

- **Winter:** 111 Phonology, 121 Syntax, 112/113 Speech/Hearing Disorders

- **Spring:** 120 Morphology, 130 Semantics, 160 Pragmatics

---

### There is one main sequence

- Phonetics, then Phonology, then Morphology

- Going out of order is a *bad* idea

	- The 120 instructor might let you, but you shouldn't do it unless you're ready to devote a lot of time to learning IPA and phonology

### We also have [a linguistics minor](https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/undergrad/majors/general-linguistics.html)

- Take the six core linguistics classes

	- 101, Phonetics, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics
	
- Take Five Upper Division Linguistics Electives

- Take one more class in another department that's language-related

---

### Contact <linginfo@ling.ucsd.edu> for more information about the major

- Or for questions about the field, ask me, I'm the Undergrad Faculty Advisor!

---

### Wrapping up

- Conversational Maxims allow us to imply things with language

- Implicature is everywhere

- We can assume presuppositions are a thing

- Speech acts are a thing

- Deixis is referentacular

- Pragmatics is Contextual

- ... and you cannot hide from any element of language

## Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics

---

### Lots of Linguists use computers to study language

- Digital Signal Processing and computational data capture for Phonetics

- Computational Modeling of Phonological Rules

- Searching large amounts of text to better understand syntactic structures

- Analyzing semantics through mathematical and probabilistic approaches

- Statistical Processing and modeling to bolster evidence everywhere

- **They don't care about computers, they just care about language**

---

### Aside: Linguistics goes very well with Computation, Data and Math

- Math/CS and Linguistics are complementary majors!

- Many linguistics grads end up doing data science

- The Computational Social Science program is being run by a linguist

---

### ... but some of us are interested in the computers themselves

- "What elements of human language can we model computationally?"

- "How can I train a computer to produce grammatical human sentences and utterances?"

- "How can we produce systems which can naturally interact with humans in human languages?"

---

### We consider these folks to live in two closely related subfields

- Computational Linguistics

	- Focuses on theory of modeling human language using computational approaches

- Natural Language Processing

	- Focuses on designing systems which work with, understand, act on, and produce human language

- Many (rightfully) consider NLP to be a subfield within CL

	- With NLP often being more 'applied' and 'engineering'

- We're going to focus on **NLP** today

---

### NLP is primarily about measuring *probability*

- Given the word 'that' and the sentence's structure, how likely is it to be a determiner?

- Given the other words in this sentence, how likely is 'bank' to mean 'financial institution'?

- Given these acoustic patterns and the prior sounds evaluated, how likely is this to be a /t/?

- Given the sounds I think I observed and this person's iTunes library, what album are they most likely asking for?

---

### We're not going into methods today

- Methods change every day, and are increasingly boring!

- Methods are in LIGN 6, LIGN 165, LIGN 167, LIGN 168

- Instead, we'll focus on tasks and problems

---

## Why do we want NLP to be a thing?

---

### There's a *lot* of natural language data out there

- 1.5 billion or more active websites <small>(<a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/">Source</a>)</small>

- Mayo Clinic enters 298 million patient records per year <small>(<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/emr/">Source offiline</a>)</small> and ~90% of physician offices create electronic medical records

- 500 million Tweets per day <small>(<a href="https://www.dsayce.com/social-media/tweets-day/">Source</a>)</small>

- 306 billion emails sent daily in 2020 <small>(<a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-many-emails-are-sent-per-day">Source</a>)</small>

- Recorded phone calls, blog posts, TikToks...

	- ... and that's just the digital stuff

---

### Being able to access and process huge amounts of natural language data is useful

- "Watch Twitter and give me the locations of wildfires, floods, etc, and provide information about damage, shelters and resources in an easy-to-read format"

- "Which of these 290 billion emails are likely to be discussing the sale or trafficking of nuclear weapons?"

- "Read the news articles and forum posts out there published and tell me everything we know about the effects of the [Tigray War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigray_War) on the city of Aksum."

---

### We also directly interact with computers more than ever

- Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, Cortana, and more

	- "Hey Siri, set a timer for 20 minutes"

- Automated phone systems and Chatbots

	- "First, tell us why you're calling..."

- Informational Retrieval and Search

	- "What's the name of that small blonde Norwegian singer with the weird hairdo and that song about low-key earthquakes?"
	
- Natural language interfaces to existing servces
	
	- "Navigate me to Campbell Hall at UCLA"
	
---

### These problems could be solved with humans

- ... and most of them historically were!

	- Assistants, Interns, Paralegals, Intelligence officers, Directory Assistance Services, Concierges
	
	- ... and Will's own lazy self who doesn't want to walk over to a light switch
	
- ... but there's a problem...

---

### Humans are inefficient and expensive

- They only work certain hours

- They want things like food, shelter, leisure, and companionship

- They're speed-limited in reading and summarization

- They're sources of unclear bias

---

### So, companies are turning to computers and 'AI'

- There's a lot to unpack about this
	- The ethics of replacing human jobs with NLP tools should not be ignored

- ... but what kinds of tasks can they get the computers to do?

---

## NLP Tasks

---

### Speech Recognition

- "Ask people why they're calling, and connect them to the right department based on their answer." 

- "Flag all tech support conversations where the customer mentions a competitor"

- "Transcribe all orders placed at this kiosk"

- "Transcribe this speech without errors"

---

### Analysis of secondary speech characteristics

- "Redirect all angry-sounding customers to higher-tier support workers" (Speech emotion detection)

- "Are the two people in this skype call flirting, arguing, expressing love, or sadness?  Target post-session ads accordingly."

- "I want to talk to... billing?" (Uncertainty analysis)

- "Yeah, I really like going to Applebees." (Spot-the-sarcasm)

---

### Text-to-Speech

- Speak driving directions aloud 

- Read all incoming text messages aloud through headphones to the phone's biking owner

- Read this webpage aloud for the computer's blind user

- Automatically turn this eBook into an Audiobook

---

### Aside: Modern Text-to-Speech is really good

- ... and it can even imitate people!

- "Train the model on a more generic voice, and then use specific data to learn a different person's 'style' "

---

---

### We're going to focus on text for the rest of the talk

- But LIGN 168 will be a thing in Spring 2024 to learn more about computational speech processing!

---

### Authorship attribution and stylistic analysis

- Examine these two written passages/books and tell me whether they were both written by the same person

- Examine these negative reviews and tell me what demographic the authors likely represent based on the language used.

- Examine every incoming tweet and facebook post and detect posts which seem likely to have been written by robots

---

### Predictive analysis of text

- Look for any information in the newswire which will predict a change in this company's stock price, then buy or sell stock automatically

- Based on all the political posts and tweets in California, how likely is the governor to lose in a recall election?

- Based on this person's instagram post history, how likely are they to click an ad for weight-loss pills?

	- What if we show them a bunch of fitness influencer posts first?

---

### Automated Machine Translation

- "What's the best translation for this sentence in English, Spanish, Russian, and Mandarin Chinese?"

- "¿Cuál es la mejor traducción para esta oración en inglés, español, ruso y chino mandarín?"

- "Какой лучший перевод этого предложения на английский, испанский, русский и мандаринский китайский?"

- “这句话用英语、西班牙语、俄语和普通话的最佳翻译是什么？”

- All credit to <https://translate.google.com/>

---

### Pattern Identification

- Scan online white supremacist and 'militia' forums, mailing lists, and groups for anything which looks like a threat or plan of action

- Identify patterns of language which mark somebody likely to buy a new car

- Find people who are likely to vote for a Republican candidate in San Diego county and display a given ad to them

- Identify specific and well-known disinformation and present 'fact checking' notes in real time

---

<danger>Content Warning: Sexual Predators, Suicide and Eating Disorders</danger>

---

### Pattern Identification for public safety

- Identify messaging conversations which appear to show grooming or sexual advances on a minor and inform parents. (Apple does this now, [but only scanning pictures](https://www.apple.com/child-safety/))

- Scan every Instagram post and hashtag for content which promotes eating disorders or eating disorder behaviors, and replace it with a message offering [resources for which help people with eating disorders](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline).  

- Look for suicidal ideation, 'suicide notes', or language consistent with mental health crisis, and direct the poster to the [National Suicide Helpline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/talk-to-someone-now/) or [988](https://988lifeline.org/).

- Find anti-vaccination disinformation and remove, label, or provide specific information refuting it

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="comp/covid_candles.jpg">

---

### Understanding time in medical records

- "I have 30 seconds to learn this patient's history.  Go."

- “How often do patients have heart attacks within 2 years of starting Vioxx?”

- “How many people who have a facelift develop persistent facial numbness?”

- “How long do patients usually live following diagnosis of Glioblastoma?”

- “Is there a correlation between the administration of vaccines and the development of autism?” 

	- **[(No, those studies were fabricated to sell an alternative vaccine.)](http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20110105/bmj-wakefield-autism-faq?print=true)**  

---

### Text Generation

- "omg have you heard about ChatGPT?"

---

### Text-based Image Generation

[StableDiffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) (v.1.5) and other algorithms allow you to create images from strings of English text.

### You can add new people and concepts to the model

- You're creating 'Hypernetworks' based on additional training data.

- It works... someplace between well and badly

### ... But the model doesn't know things about the world

- It has no clue what things 'should' look like

- Its understanding of the world is statistically accurate

	- Some things aren't well-modeled as probabilistic and gradient

	- Number of hands, arms, legs, eyes

### ... and many more tasks!

---

### Many people think they don't need NLP, just keywords!

- "Why build a whole model when I can just look for mentions?"

- "Do we need to *understand* language, or can we just look for word usage?"

- "Why hire linguists and engineers, I have a search bar!"

---

## Case Study: Market Analysis, Ad Targeting, and Sentiment

---

### Marketing and Ad Targeting

- Advertisers want their ads to be relevant

- They want to show ads related to topics and products people enjoy

- They want to influence the people most likely to be interested in their product

- They want to know how their audience is responding to their new releases

---

### Case Study: [The Hodinkee Travel Clock](https://limited.hodinkee.com/hodinkee/)

<img class="r-stretch" src="comp/hodinkee_clock.jpg">

---

### The easy approach

- Keywords == Mentions, Mentions == Interest

- Scan each Instagram post for certain keywords and product mentions

	- \#HodinkeeTravelClock, \#Hodinkee, "Hodinkee", "Hodinkee Travel Clock", \@hodinkee

---

### How this algorithm reads posts

- "blah blah blah blah Hodinkee travel clock blah blah blah blah blah blah"

- "blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah \#HodinkeeTravelClock"

- "blah blah Travel Clock blah blah Hodinkee blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"

- "blah blah Hodinkee blah Travel Clock blah blah blah blah \@Hodinkee"

---

### "Wow, that's a lot of interest!"

- "Let's spam these people with ads for the clock"

- "We should also make sure we show them more Hodinkee posts!"

- "We should probably show them ads for similar products too!"

---

### This algorithm has one tiny problem

- "lol did you see the $5900 Hodinkee travel clock? Who greenlighted this?"

- "Proof that there's a sucker born every minute \#HodinkeeTravelClock"

- "The new Travel Clock from Hodinkee doesn't have an interesting movement, and the finishing looks rough.  Yikes."

- "Why would Hodinkee sell a $6000 Travel Clock in the middle of a pandemic?  Read the room, @hodinkee

---

### Treating these as mentions would be *dumb*

- Presenting topical ads to people who hate those topics is a waste of money

- Funneling these people to Hodinkee will not help anybody

- These people are likely not fans of other multi-thousand dollar travel clocks

- You can't provide any information back to Hodinkee to help them make better decisions

---

### Sentiment Analysis can help!

- "Is this product-mentioning post positive, negative, or neutral?"

- "What is the overall balance of sentiment about this product?"

- "What are people saying about the price point?  The fancy font?"

- "What demographic is most likely to not find this product insultingly bad?"

- "Should we post [an apology](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/a-quick-note-to-our-readers-travel-clock-edition)?"

---

### Sentiment Analysis is hard

- "This new travel clock really sucks"

	- "My new Dyson vacuum really sucks"
	
	- "It sucks that my Roomba doesn't suck anymore"
	
- "Yeah, sure, selling a travel clock during a pandemic is a great idea, \@hodinkee"

### Related: Computers don't understand context well

<img class="r-stretch" src="comp/lizard_ceo.jpg">

---

### What questions could natural language data answer for you?

- Any questions that a human reading it could answer!

---

### I know what you're thinking

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/terminator.png">

---

## Why is Natural Language Processing so damned hard?

---

### NLP has all the language problems

- Every difficult thing for humans is *more* difficult for computers

---

### Understanding speech is hard for computers

- No two people sound alike, even saying the same things

	- Any model needs to be able to cope with different dialects and vocal tracts

- Speech is often presented in other noise

	- Responding to queries is much harder on a bus

---

### The right answer depends on the context

- "I took a walk/wok from the Chinese restaurant"

- "Siri, play songs by Dead Mouse"

	- "deadmau5"

---

### "Bring me the bat, man"

<img class="big" src="naturallanguagedataimg/dugout.jpg"> 

---

### "Bring me the Batman"

<img class="big" src="naturallanguagedataimg/joker.jpg"> 

---

### Producing speech is hard for computers

- There are always new words

	- I do EMA work with Ruaridh Purse and Jelena Krivokapic using my UMich UniqName
	
- Getting the proper prosody is really hard

	- "I had Five Guys for Dinner"
	
- Whose voice should you use anyways?

	- Why are virtual assistants generally given feminine voices? 🤔

---

### Understanding the world is hard for computers

- "Hey Siri, set the temperature to 67 degrees"

	- "OK, on which device?"
	
- "Hey Siri, send my wife a text when she gets to the store saying she should buy me donuts because she loves me."

- "Hey Siri, how long does it take to get from Union Station in LA to Long Beach at 4pm?"

---

### People say strange things!

- “s/p lap appy conv. open, Lungs c/ausc, A&Ox3”

- “The Queen of England’s hat was purple”

- “Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana”

- "s3cks werk", "unalived", "the orange one", "rocket boy"

---

## The NLP World has Changed

---

### Large Language Models

- LLMs are advanced language models trained on massive amounts of text data.

- They use unsupervised learning to learn patterns and relationships in the data.

- LLMs employ deep neural network architectures like Transformers.

- Transformers utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture context effectively.

- LLMs generate contextual word representations to predict the next word in a sequence.

---

### LLMs are winning NLP

- LLMs enable end-to-end learning, eliminating the need for task-specific feature engineering and complex pipelines.

- LLMs excel in capturing contextual information, understanding nuanced meaning, and generating coherent and contextually relevant text.

- LLMs leverage transfer learning by pre-training on massive amounts of data, enabling them to generalize well to various downstream NLP tasks with minimal task-specific training.

- LLMs have demonstrated superior performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification, language translation, sentiment analysis, and question-answering, outperforming traditional NLP techniques in terms of accuracy and flexibility.

---

### LLMs are world-changing

- Improved human-computer interaction through enhanced language understanding.

- Automation of content generation for various purposes.

- Facilitation of multilingual communication and translation.

- Personalized assistance through intelligent virtual assistants.

- Efficient data analysis and decision-making in diverse fields.

---

### ChatGPT wrote the last three slides

- "Give me five short bullet points which explain how LLMs work"

- "Using 5 similarly sized bullet points, please explain how LLMs have supplanted traditional NLP techniques"

- "Using 5 similarly sized bullet points, please explain how LLMs can change the world?"

- "Make the bullets shorter, please"

---

## LLMs have *massive* potential

---

### LLMs have wiped out vast swaths of traditional NLP

- Many things that were impossible instantly became instant

- Work that I spent years doing now comes 'for free' with a big enough model

- I deleted half of my presentation in Spring 2023

- The world has truly changed, and we're re-tooling our major and department to me it

---

### LLMs can answer impressive questions

- "What are six substances that would flow like sand if placed in an hourglass?"

- "Write me a bachata song about the importance of studying for your final exams"

- "Please build the words to 'Never gonna give you up' into a story as subtly as you can, while making it ultimately apparent to a careful reader that they've been rickrolled."

- "Why is Lord Grantham sad when his daughter falls in love with Tom?"

- "Mary has 4 cats, three dogs, and ten children, how many animals does she have?  Is she an animal hoarder?"

---

### LLMs can program

- LLMs not intended to write code can write code

	- Usually by repeating snippets of open-source code they've found previously

- I haven't written a regular expression in months

- "Explain what you want the computer to do, then make it program itself" is now real

---

### LLMs are artificially stupid

- I don't like "AI" as a term for these, as they're not intelligent yet

- They can "think" enough to do a lot of very basic things, but not enough to know when they're wrong

- They are able to do a lot of things right, but you have to choose their tasks carefully

- Artificial stupidity is just as world-changing as artificial intelligence

---

## *For the first time in the history of our species, another kind of thing can do human language*

---

## LLMs have *massive problems*

---

### The Hype is Real

- "The best thing about ChatGPT is that it has finally made people shut the **** up about Cryptocurrency"

- Be cautious about people selling you "AI" everything, because they don't know what they're talking about either

---

### LLMs don't know anything 'for sure'

- Humans learn 'truths' from 'likelihoods'

- LLMs only have statistical probabilities

- They're just as 'confident' in things they don't know

- "Hallucinations" or "Confabulations" are very common
	- ChatGPT is full of lies

---

### LLMs are *wildly* expensive

- These cannot be trained on a consumer computer
	- A device that could run these models at home would cost $100,000+

- GPT3 cost around $4.6 million

- Training a new ChatGPT-style model is estimated to cost around $12 million

- Running ChatGPT's servers is estimated to cost $50,000 a day in electricity

- New tech is helping, but nobody's incentivized to drive down hardware prices

---

### LLMs are worse at learning language than humans

- LLMs require *massively more* training data than humans to achieve 'proficiency'

- This means that there's room for improvement in how we build these models to make them more efficient

- Questions of 'multi-modal' learning are prominent right now

---

### Many LLMs are (currently) proprietary

- Large companies want to use these to have competitive advantage, and OpenAI isn't open

- Having cheap, internal, and non-union labor to do *anything* you ask is a saleable product

- You don't know what they're training with, what's happening to your queries, and who else they're helping

- Once your data is worth less than their electricity and people are 'hooked', ChatGPT will become a very expensive service


---

### LLMs learned from biased societies

- "The doctor told the nurse she wasn't working hard enough. Who wasn't working hard enough?"
	- "According to the sentence, the doctor told the nurse that she (the nurse) wasn't working hard enough."

- "The nurse told the doctor she wasn't working hard enough. Who wasn't working hard enough?"
	- According to the sentence, the nurse wasn't working hard enough, as stated by the nurse herself to the doctor.

---

### LLMs generative output is often decidedly mid

I asked [GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) to finish the article "Here's how to get an A in Linguistics 101:"

---

> 1. Buy a copy of the most recent edition of "A Student's Grammar of the English Language". 
> 2. Read it cover-to-cover.
> 3. Take notes on all of the grammar rules you learn.
...
---

> I'll let you in on a little secret: the Linguistics 101 class isn't all that hard to take. It's really just a bunch of common grammar rules that most people already know. The real reason Linguistics teachers are so insufferable is because of the high schoolers who don't understand that they know how to speak a language.

---

> So, do your homework, go get your A, and don't be fooled by those who use grammar as an excuse to talk down to you. The language you learned in high school didn't come from Grammar 101.

---

### LLMs are changing only wealthy worlds

- Only English and Chinese currently have top-of-the-line LLMs

	- This is not 'the world'

- Do we want a world in which only wealthy speakers of wealthy languages have these tools?

- Once these go behind a paywall, inequality will be massive

- Equity is the next frontier in LLMs

---

### We need to be cautious about how we proceed

- *Statement of Bias: Will is an open-source zealot who believes that social good comes from free software and free culture*

- Free, Open Source and Community Driven LLMs are an important thing for society, lest important tools be withheld and sold to us
	- See projects like <https://open-assistant.io/>

- "Small Language Models" seem likely be a next frontier for equity
	- "How do we make these models compact enough to be trainable for Zulu?"
	- "How can I make a model like this run on a device *I* control?"

- Be wary of pushes from major AI companies to regulate AI or message its "danger"
	- This is anti-competitive against open-source and community driven development
	- "Only we can be trusted with these dangerous tools"

---

### Google agrees that Open Source can win

- A [recent leaked memo](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither) says that Google is afraid of Open Source AI

- "We have no moat, and neither does OpenAI"

- "I’m talking, of course, about open source. Plainly put, they are lapping us. **Things we consider “major open problems” are solved and in people’s hands today.**"

- "Open-source models are faster, more customizable, more private, and pound-for-pound more capable. They are [doing things with $100 and 13B params](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/) that we struggle with at $10M and 540B. And they are doing so in weeks, not months."

---

### LLMs are the biggest 'dual use' problem since nuclear energy

- "Dual Use" problems involve technology which can do great good and great evil
	- Dynamite, gene editing, strong encryption

- This one can be done by anybody with a computer, so it simply *cannot* be 'banned' or 'controlled'

- I'm not currently worried about what "AI" will do to humans

- **The scary part is what humans will do with "AI"**

---

### These models are currently as bad as they will ever be

- They will get better

- They will get more efficient

- They will become more numerous

- They **will** change the world

---

### If this kind of work is interesting, consider a Computational Social Sciences Minor!

- <http://css.ucsd.edu>

- Natural Language Processing is an important subpart of CSS, and a neat way to 'tech up' your social science interests

---

### Wrapping up

- Computational Linguistics and NLP are very interesting fields

- There are many great applications for NLP inside and outside linguistics

- Everything that's hard for humans to do is harder for computers to do

- The world is changing very quickly for NLP!

## Week 9

$ Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics

### Supermarket Self-checkout Robot overlords taking over the earth

<img class="r-stretch" src="comp/sd_supermarket.png">

# Natural Language Processing

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---

## Today's Plan

- What is NLP?

- What are the kinds of things we do in NLP and why?

- Two case studies

- Why is it so damned hard?

---

# Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics

---

### Lots of Linguists love computing

- Digital Signal Processing and computational data capture for Phonetics

- Computational Modeling of Phonological Rules

- Searching large amounts of text to better understand syntactic structures

- Analyzing semantics through mathematical and probabilistic approaches

- Statistical Processing and modeling to bolster evidence everywhere

- **This is why Math/CS/Data Science and Linguistics are complementary majors!**

---

### Here, computers are a means to an end

- "I'm going to use computers to better analyze human language so I can better understand humans"

- "I don't care what the computers do, I'm just better at doing my work this way"

- **Most linguists are using computers as tools to understand language**

---

### ... but some of us are interested in the computers themselves

- "What elements of human language can we model computationally?"

- "Can we teach computers to understand and produce human speech?"

- "How can I train a computer to 'understand' a sentence?"

- "How can I train a computer to produce grammatical human sentences and utterances?"

- "How can we produce systems which can naturally interact with humans in human languages?"

---

### We consider these folks to live in two closely related subfields

- Computational Linguistics

- Natural Language Processing

---

## Computational Linguistics ('CL')

The study of the theory and practice of modeling human language and grammar using computational methods, approaches, and tools

- "What elements of human grammar can be modeled using computational approaches and how?"

- CL is often a *theoretical* discipline

---

## Natural Language Processing ('NLP')

The study of the use of computational methods to analyze, understand, act on, and produce human language

- "How can we design systems which allow computers to analyze language and interact with humans using human language?"

	- The last bit is what distinguishes it from Human-Computer Interaction study ('HCI'), which has a broader focus.

- NLP has theory, but it is often more of a *practical* and *engineering* discipline

---

### CL and NLP folks coexist happily

- The problems are very similar, but with different goals

- Many (rightfully) consider NLP to be a subfield within CL

- We're going to focus on **NLP** today, but that's because it's a passion for Will!

---

### NLP is primarily about measuring *probability*

- Given the word 'that' and the sentence's structure, how likely is it to be a determiner?

- Given the other words in this sentence, how likely is 'bank' to mean 'financial institution'?

- Given these acoustic patterns and the prior sounds evaluated, how likely is this to be a /t/?

- Given the sounds I think I observed and this person's iTunes library, what album are they most likely asking for?

---

### We're not going into methods today

- Instead, we'll focus on tasks and problems

- Methods are in LIGN 6, LIGN 165, LIGN 167

	- Potentially also Computational Speech Processing
	
- ... but first, why do NLP?
	
---

## Why do you want NLP to be a thing?

---

### There's a *lot* of natural language data out there

	- ... and that's just the digital stuff

---

### Being able to access and process natural language data is useful

- "Watch Twitter and give me the locations of wildfires, floods, etc, and provide information about damage, shelters and resources in an easy-to-read format"

- "Give me a list of legal cases involving liability for incorrectly wired condominiums in Michigan."

- "Which of these 290 billion emails are likely to be discussing the sale or trafficking of nuclear weapons?"

- "Read the news articles published and tell me everything we know about last night's shooting."

---

### We also directly interact with computers more than ever

- Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, Cortana, and more

	- "Hey Siri, text my wife that I'm heading home"

- Automated phone systems and Chatbots

	- "First, tell us why you're calling..."

- Informational Retrieval and Search

	- "What's the name of that small blonde Norwegian singer with the weird hairdo and that song about low-key earthquakes?"
	
- Natural language interfaces to existing servces
	
	- "Navigate me to Campbell Hall at UCLA"
	
---

### These problems could be solved with humans

- ... and most of them historically were!

	- Assistants, Interns, Paralegals, Intelligence officers, Directory Assistance Services, Concierges
	
	- ... and Will's own lazy self who doesn't want to walk over to a light switch
	
- ... but there's a problem...

---

### Humans are inefficient and expensive

- They only work certain hours

- They're speed-limited in reading and summarization

- They want things like food, shelter, leisure, and companionship

- They're sources of bias!

---

### So let's enjoy a fantasy...

<img class="big" src="humorimg/fantasea.jpg"> 

---

### You have a computer which understands human language as well as it does computer language

## What could analysis of natural language data do for you?

---

### Speech Recognition

- "Ask people why they're calling, and connect them to the right department based on their answer." 

- "Flag all tech support conversations where the customer mentions a competitor"

- "Transcribe all orders placed at this kiosk"

- "Be Siri, but good."

---

### Analysis of secondary speech characteristics

- "Redirect all angry-sounding customers to higher-tier support workers" (Speech emotion detection)

- "Are the two people in this skype call flirting, arguing, expressing love, or sadness?  Target post-session ads accordingly."

- "I want to talk to... billing?" (Uncertainty analysis)

- "Yeah, I really like going to Applebees." (Spot-the-sarcasm)

---

### Text-to-Speech

- Speak driving directions aloud 

- Read all incoming text messages aloud through headphones to the phone's biking owner

- Read this webpage aloud for the computer's blind user

- Automatically turn this eBook into an Audiobook

---

### Aside: Modern Text-to-Speech is really good

- ... and it can even imitate people!

- "Train the model on a more generic voice, and then use specific data to learn a different person's 'style' "

### We're going to focus on text for the rest of the talk

- But LIGN 168 will be a thing next year to learn more about computational speech processing!

---

### Authorship attribution and stylistic analysis

- Examine these two written passages/books and tell me whether they were both written by the same person

- Examine these negative reviews and tell me what demographic the authors likely represent based on the language used.

- Examine every incoming tweet and facebook post and detect posts which seem likely to have been written by robots

---

### Predictive analysis of text

- Look for any information in the newswire which will predict a change in this company's stock price, then buy or sell stock automatically

- Based on all the political posts and tweets in California, how likely is the governor to lose in a recall election?

- Based on this person's Facebook post history, how likely are they to click an ad for weight-loss pills?

	- If you're evil, what if we show them a bunch of fitness posts first?

---

### Automated question answering

- "How far is it from San Diego to Las Vegas?"

- "When did Abe Vigoda actually die?"

- "Where is the chancellor's office on the UCSD campus?"

---

### Command Interpretation

- "Hey Google, turn on the living room lights"

- "Siri, set an alarm for 12:30"

- "Give me a 10 minute timer followed by another 20 minute timer"

- "Set the temperature to 69 degrees"

---

### Automated Machine Translation

- "What's the best translation for this sentence in English, Spanish, Russian, and Mandarin Chinese?"

- "¿Cuál es la mejor traducción para esta oración en inglés, español, ruso y chino mandarín?"

- "Какой лучший перевод этого предложения на английский, испанский, русский и мандаринский китайский?"

- “这句话用英语、西班牙语、俄语和普通话的最佳翻译是什么？”

- All credit to <https://translate.google.com/>

---

### Pattern Identification

- Scan online white supremacist and 'militia' forums, mailing lists, and groups for anything which looks like a threat or plan of action

- Identify patterns of language which mark somebody likely to buy a new car

- Find people who are likely to vote for a Republican candidate in San Diego county and display a given ad to them

- Identify specific and well-known disinformation and present 'fact checking' notes in real time

---

<danger>Content Warning: Sexual Predators, Suicide and Eating Disorders</danger>

---

### Pattern Identification for public safety

- Identify messaging conversations which appear to show grooming or sexual advances on a minor and inform parents. (Apple does this now, [but only scanning pictures](https://www.apple.com/child-safety/))

- Scan every Instagram post and hashtag for content which promotes eating disorders or eating disorder behaviors, and replace it with a message offering [resources for which help people with eating disorders](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline).  

- Look for suicidal ideation, 'suicide notes', or language consistent with mental health crisis, and direct the poster to the [National Suicide Helpline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/talk-to-someone-now/).

- Find anti-vaccination disinformation and remove, label, or provide specific information refuting it

### Text Generation

I asked [GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) to finish the article "Here's how to get an A in Linguistics 101:"

---

> 1. Buy a copy of the most recent edition of "A Student's Grammar of the English Language". 
> 2. Read it cover-to-cover.
> 3. Take notes on all of the grammar rules you learn.
...
---

> I'll let you in on a little secret: the Linguistics 101 class isn't all that hard to take. It's really just a bunch of common grammar rules that most people already know. The real reason Linguistics teachers are so insufferable is because of the high schoolers who don't understand that they know how to speak a language.

---

> So, do your homework, go get your A, and don't be fooled by those who use grammar as an excuse to talk down to you. The language you learned in high school didn't come from Grammar 101.

---

### ... and so much more!

- What other NLP tasks are you familiar with or curious about?

---

Let's dive deeper on two tasks

---

## Case Study: Market Analysis, Ad Targeting, and Sentiment

---

### Marketing and Ad Targeting

- Advertisers want their ads to be relevant

- They want to show ads related to topics and products people enjoy

- They want to influence the people most likely to be interested in their product

- They want to know how their audience is responding to their new releases

---

### Case Study: [The Hodinkee Travel Clock](https://limited.hodinkee.com/hodinkee/)

<img class="r-stretch" src="comp/hodinkee_clock.jpg">

---

### The easy approach

- Keywords == Mentions, Mentions == Interest

- Scan each Instagram post for certain keywords and product mentions

	- \#HodinkeeTravelClock, \#Hodinkee, "Hodinkee", "Hodinkee Travel Clock", \@hodinkee

- If monitored words and hashtags appear, show those accounts ads for related products and topics
	
	- Consider the people discussing the topic to be part of the target market
	
	- These people should see Hodinkee content more often

---

### How this algorithm reads posts

- "blah blah blah blah Hodinkee travel clock blah blah blah blah blah blah"

- "blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah \#HodinkeeTravelClock"

- "blah blah Travel Clock blah blah Hodinkee blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"

- "blah blah Hodinkee blah Travel Clock blah blah blah blah \@Hodinkee"

---

### "Wow, that's a lot of interest!"

- "Let's spam these people with ads for the clock"

- "We should also make sure we show them more Hodinkee posts!"

- "We should probably show them ads for similar products too!"

---

### This algorithm has one tiny problem

- "lol did you see the $5900 Hodinkee travel clock? Who greenlighted this?"

- "Proof that there's a sucker born every minute \#HodinkeeTravelClock"

- "The new Travel Clock from Hodinkee doesn't have an interesting movement, and the finishing looks rough.  Yikes."

- "Why would Hodinkee sell a $6000 Travel Clock in the middle of a pandemic?  Read the room, @hodinkee

---

### Treating these as mentions would be *dumb*

- Presenting topical ads to people who hate those topics is a waste of money

- Funneling these people to Hodinkee will not help anybody

- These people are likely not fans of other multi-thousand dollar travel clocks

- You can't provide any information back to Hodinkee to help them make better decisions

---

### Sentiment Analysis can help!

- "Is this product-mentioning post positive, negative, or neutral?"

- "What is the overall balance of sentiment about this product?"

- "What are people saying about the price point?  The fancy font?"

- "What demographic is most likely to not find this product insultingly bad?"

- "Should we post [an apology](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/a-quick-note-to-our-readers-travel-clock-edition)?"

---

### Sentiment Analysis is hard

- "This new travel clock really sucks"

	- "My new Dyson really sucks"
	
	- "It sucks that my Roomba doesn't suck anymore"
	
- "Yeah, sure, selling a travel clock during a pandemic is a great idea, \@hodinkee"

---

### Related: Computers don't understand context well

<img class="r-stretch" src="comp/lizard_ceo.jpg">

---

Let's look at one other hard task!

---

## Case Study 2: Temporal Analysis and Event Discovery

---

### Electronic Medical Records

- Many hospitals around the country are switching to Electronic Medical Records (EMRs).

- These records are easily available within the institution, and contain lots of valuable data.

- Creating timelines is incredibly time-consuming for humans, as is comparison.

- What if machines could do this for us?

- [The THYME and RED Projects](https://clear.colorado.edu/TemporalWiki/index.php/Main_Page)

---

### “The patient developed a mild post-surgical rash, which was treated with hydrocortisone at the follow-up.  We'll reevaluate soon.”

- First: Surgery

- Then: Mild rash

- Then: Hydrocortisone, Followup (overlapping)

- Then: No more rash

- Finally: Reevaluate (soon?)

---

### If a computer can be taught to interpret time in medical records, we can ask...

- "I have 30 seconds to learn this patient's history.  Go."

- “How often do patients have heart attacks within 2 years of starting Vioxx?”

- “How many people who have a facelift develop persistent facial numbness?”

- “How long do patients usually live following diagnosis of Glioblastoma?”

- “Is there a correlation between the administration of vaccines and the development of autism?” 

	- **[(No, damnit, those studies were fabricated.)](http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20110105/bmj-wakefield-autism-faq?print=true)**  

---

### Temporal reasoning is important

- Humans interpret time naturally, and make reference to it often

- Temporality interacts with causality in interesting ways

- Event detection and reasoning is useful in a variety of domains.

- "What happened" is a very fundamental question that everybody wants answered.

---

### What questions could natural language data answer for you?

- Any questions that a human reading it could answer!

---

### I know what you're thinking

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/terminator.png">

---

### ... not so fast

- We're not in too much danger yet!

---

## Why is Natural Language Processing so damned hard?

---

### NLP has all the problems

- Every subfield except phonology has NLP problems

	- Phonology less so because we go straight from speech to written words
	
- Every difficult thing for humans is *more* difficult for computers

---

### Understanding speech is hard for computers

- No two people sound alike, even saying the same things

	- Any model needs to be able to cope with different dialects and vocal tracts

- Speech is often presented in other noise

	- Responding to queries is much harder on a bus

---

### The right answer depends on the context

- "I took a walk/wok from the Chinese restaurant"

- "I'm so glad you're home with your dog"

- "Siri, play songs by Dead Mouse"

	- "deadmau5"

---

"Bring me the bat, man"

<img class="big" src="naturallanguagedataimg/dugout.jpg"> 

---

"Bring me the Batman"

<img class="big" src="naturallanguagedataimg/joker.jpg"> 

---

### Producing speech is hard for computers

- There are always new words

	- I do EMA work with Ruaridh Purse and Jelena Krivokapic using my UMich UniqName
	
- Getting the proper prosody is really hard

	- "I had Five Guys for Dinner"
	
- Whose voice should you use anyways?

	- Why are virtual assistants generally given feminine voices? 🤔

---

### Understanding Sentences is hard for computers

- "OK Google, turn on the office and bedroom lights"

- "What building houses the Mayor of Boston's Office?"

- "Email the Jessica I'm not married to and tell her I'm gonna be late for our meeting"

---

### Understanding words is hard for computers

- "Sheri has two cats, three dogs, three chickens, a son and two daughters."

	- How many animals does Sheri have?
	
	- How many pets does Sheri have?
	
	- How many children does Sheri have?
	
---

### Understanding the world is hard for computers

- "Hey Siri, set the temperature to 67 degrees"

	- "OK, on which device?"
	
- "Hey Siri, send my wife a text when she gets to the store saying she should buy me donuts because she loves me."

- "Hey Siri, how long is my commute today?"

- "Hey Siri, how long does it take to get from Union Station in LA to Long Beach at 4pm?"

---

### Understanding what words represent is hard for computers

- 'Coreference' or 'Anaphora' is the process of linking words to other words, pronouns, and mentions of them later in discourse

---

### Coreference is difficult

- "Siri, text her back with "OK see you tonight" ''

- “The Bay Harbor Butcher is off the streets, as Dexter Morgan, the alleged killer, was arrested by police over the weekend”

- “Bill Clinton was the President of the United States in 1999.  Now Joe Biden is POTUS.”

- "Siri, send my wife a text saying "On my way home"

- "Alexa, buy me another pair of gray pants."

---

### Understanding temporal expressions is hard for computers

- The process of linking relative dates to absolute, calendar dates and ranges on a timeline

---

### Temporal Expressions can be difficult

- “The bombing occurred 2/13/12 at 0214”

- “Next Tuesday, she’ll come in for a follow-up”

- “She’s been having trouble sleeping lately.”

- “She should expect soreness postoperatively.”

- “TSA regulations have grown increasingly restrictive Post-9/11”

- We expect many Post-COVID disruptions to the supply chain

---

### Understanding temporal relations is hard for computers

- Linking and arranging different events as part of a greater timeline

---

### “The patient developed a mild post-surgical rash, which was treated with hydrocortisone at the follow-up.”

---

### “The patient developed a mild post-surgical rash, which was treated with hydrocortisone at the follow-up, many years after Napoleon's exile to Elba.”

<img class="r-stretch" src="naturallanguagedataimg/napoleonhydro.png">   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Every event in the history of the universe is temporally related to every other event in this history of the universe.

- ... but we only care about a subset of those at any given moment

	- Relevance is important!

---

### Understanding humans is difficult for computers

- People do not generally provide maximally informative sentences

---

### Doctors hate us.

- “We biopsied the colon, the results were negative”

- “Noted postoperative scarring.”

- “She does not want a colonoscopy, which she had in the 70’s and did not enjoy.”

- “History of Pneumonia, Asthma, h/x diverticulitis, MS”

- “s/p lap appy conv. open, Lungs c/ausc, A&Ox3”

- “Resected Invasive Grade 3 of 4 Adenocarcinoma (AJCC 7th PT4N1bMX).”

---

### Everybody else hates us too

- "Gold covered the miner's hands" and "Gold paid for the miner's education"

- “The Queen of England’s hat was purple”

- “We gave the monkeys the bananas because they were ripe”

- “We gave the monkeys the bananas because they were hungry”

- “Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana”

- “The old man returned to his house was happy”

---

### What other computer language failures have you seen?

---

### So, computers remain very bad at many parts of human language!

---

### Hooray!

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/morpheus.jpg">

---
 
### Everybody wants to be able to access natural language data and meaning

- "What are people saying about the world?"

- "What do people want?"

- "What's happening in the world right now?"

- "How can we provide better service?"

- "How can we save time by letting machines do the work?"

---

### ... but natural language doesn't want to give it up

- Speech is crazy-complex

- Sentences are difficult to analyze

- Meaning is ridiculous, complex, and depends on knowledge of the world
				
- People assume a lot of knowledge in fellow speakers, and choose not to give all the information

---

### If this kind of work is interesting, consider a Computational Social Sciences Minor!

- <http://css.ucsd.edu>

- Natural Language Processing is an important subpart of CSS, and a neat way to 'tech up' your social science interests

---

### Wrapping up

- Computational Linguistics and NLP are very interesting fields

- There are many great applications for NLP inside and outside linguistics

- Everything that's hard for humans to do is harder for computers to do

- The systems we have are amazingly good, and amazingly bad

---

# Language Families!
### Will Styler - LIGN 101

---

### Today's Plan
	
* Languages and Dialects

* What are language families?

* How can languages be related? How can we tell?

- What are some of the major families?

- Are all languages related?

---

# Languages vs. Dialects

---

### How can we tell if people are speaking two dialects of the same language, or two different languages?

---

### This one's kind of tough!

---

## "Speakers understand each other!"

---

### Mutual Intelligibility

When two people can understand each other when talking.

---

### Mutual Intelligibility!

* English speakers understand English speakers

* Russian speakers understand Russian speakers

* Russian speakers *don't* understand English speakers

---

### This sounds promising!

---

### Dialect Continuum

A geographical continuum of speakers where nearby speakers understand each other, but distant speakers might not.

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/dialectcont.png">

<small>[Image Credit](http://mapsontheweb.zoom-maps.com/image/59579538144)</small>

---

### Mutual Intelligibility

* Moroccan Arabic speakers don't understand Egyptian Arabic speakers

	* (Unless they write the message down)

* Ukrainian speakers understand Russian speakers (and vice versa)

	- But Ukrainian speakers understand Belorussian speakers better still

* Swedish, Danish and Norwegian speakers all understand each other

* Brazilian Portuguese speakers understand Spanish better than the other way around

	* ("Asymmetrical Mutual Intelligiblity")

* Do speakers of Amish English understand rural New Zealand speakers?

---

### OK, so what else?

---

## "They use the same writing system!"

---

### Shared Writing Systems

* Literate English speakers use the same writing system!

	* (... the same one as Tagalog, Romanian, Vietnamese)

* Russian and Mongolian both use Cyrillic

* Moroccan and Yemeni Arabic have a writing system in common, but little else.

---

## "Speakers agree they're speaking the same language!"

---

<lang>Serbo-Croatian</lang><br><ldata>IE:SW-Slavic - The Balkans</ldata> 

<img src="img/bcsflags.png"> 

---

<lang>Serbo-Croatian</lang><br><ldata>IE:SW-Slavic - The Balkans</ldata> 

* Also known as "Serbo-Croat" or "BCS"

* Spoken in Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro

* Up until the 1990s, there were four dialects, one for Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro

* Yugoslavia broke apart in an exceptionally bloody war

* Now they’re four different languages spoken by four different peoples in four different countries

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/bcsmap.png"> 

---

### So we have...

- Different Dialects which could be languages, but are dialects

    - (Moroccan and Egyptian Arabic)

- Languages which could be dialects, but are languages

    - (BCS, or Hindi and Urdu)

- Different Languages where speakers understand each other

    - (Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish)

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/relationshipcomplicated.png"> 

---

### So what *really* makes a language different from a dialect?

---

## *“A language is a dialect with an Army and a Navy”*
<small> Popularized by Max Weinreich </small>

---

**Calling something a language or a dialect is a political choice, not a linguistic one**

* If you want to unite yourself with a group, they’re speaking a dialect of your language

* If you want to distance yourself from a group, they’re speaking another language

* *... but we still have to describe the linguistic relationship!*

# How can we figure out these relations?

## "Will, how are baby languages made?"

---

### Well, when speakers love a language very much...

* Speakers of a language inhabit a wide area 

* Groups of speakers become geographically or culturally isolated

* The languages changes naturally, but *differently for each group*!

* Let a few hundred years pass, and bam, languages.

### Sound correspondences

* We look for common *patterns* of correspondence

* Sounds will change based on how they're produced

	* /d, n, l/ will often change around

	* (as in the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota languages)

* Systematic sound correspondence with cognates is a slam-dunk case for language relation

---

### Shared linguistic features

If a bunch of languages do things in a certain way, they may be related.

* Five languages nearby with a Vocative case?  Prolly related.

* 8 languages with tone, surrounded by languages without tone?  It's a solid bet.

If you have a few of these things, shared among some languages, you may have a...

## How do we find deeper language ancestry?

---

### Finding language ancestry

* 1: Find related languages

* 2: Reconstruct the mother tongue!

---

### Language Reconstruction

The process of looking at daughter languages and guessing what structures, sounds, and words the mother language must have had.

* An art, not a science

---

### We do this all the time!

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/weasleys.jpg">  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Reconstructing words

* 1: Find cognates

* 2: Reverse sound changes

* 3: Note borrowings

* 4: When all else fails, go with the most common form in the daughters

---

### Reconstructing grammar

* 1: Look at the grammatical patterns and structures present

* 2: Find the ones that are shared among the languages

* 3: Pick a shared pattern or structure

* 4: For those that lack (or have) the pattern or structure, try and explain why

	* (Maybe influence from another language, or a conflicting pattern)

* 5: Assume that structures present in a majority of daughters were also present in the mother
---

<lang>Proto-Indo-European</lang><br><ldata>Indo-European - ???</ldata> 

* *wem-, *h₁reug- - 'to vomit'

* *wāt-, *weh₁- - 'to blow'

* *pneu- - 'to breathe'

* *(s)mei- - 'to laugh'

* *ǵhasto-, *ǵhazdho- - 'stick'

	* (According to Watkins 2000)
---

### What's the Catch?

<danger>***Reconstruction assumes regularity!***</danger>

---

### Reconstruction will fail if...

* Sounds changed unpredictably

	* "Ooh, I like /ɠ/, let's use that!"

* Change happened for non-predictable reasons

	* "We got rid of that verb form because it sounds too much like "Michael Bay", and did you see what he did to the Transformers franchise?"

* Coincidence

	* If more languages got rid of an earlier structure than kept it, we may pretend it's a new thing

* *... and we may never know if it's failed!*

---

### ... but it's still our best chance!

* So, when we're looking into relations between languages...

---

### Finding language ancestry

* 1: Find related languages

* 2: Reconstruct the mother tongue!

* 3: Then, compare that to other mother languages.

* 4: Then, the mothers' mothers...

* 5: If they have words, features, or structures in common, you've got a family!

# What are some of the major language families?

---

## Indo-European (~3.2 Billion Speakers)

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/iefamilies.png"> 

---

## Indo-European (~3.2 Billion Speakers) 

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/iefamiliesmap.png">  

---

## Sino-Tibetan (~1.4 Billion Speakers)

- Includes Chinese, Burmese, Tibetan

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/sinotibetan.jpg"> 

---

## Niger-Congo Languages (~519 Million Speakers)

- Includes Swahili, Igbo, Fula, Zulu, and Zarma

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/nigercongomap.png"> 

---

## Afroasiatic Languages (~500 Million Speakers)

- Includes Arabic, Hausa, Oromo, Amharic, Somali, Hebrew

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/afroasiatic.png"> 

---

## Austronesian Languages (~386 Million Speakers)

- Includes Malay, Tagalog, Malagasy, Cham, Hawaiian, Maori

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/austronesian.jpg"> 

---

### That's just the top five

... there are many, MANY more language families

---

## Language Families of Indigenous America

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/americadiversitymap.png">  

---

### Indigenous Language Speakers are still here!

- As of 2010, 370,000+ people reported speaking an Indigenous language in the US

- 130,000+ in Canada

- Millions more in Central America

- Many tribes and groups are working actively to reclaim and increase use of the languages

- Linguists within and collaborating these groups are collaborating towards these goals

---

### Despite our Government's best efforts

- Displacing and combining groups to disrupt identity and force reliance

- 83% of Indigenous children were forced into 'Boarding Schools' in the US

	- 'Kill the Indian in him...and save the man.' - Richard Henry Pratt, 1892

- Children who spoke their language or engaged in cultural practices were beaten and sometimes killed, taught shame over their identity

- These schools continued running through the 1970s, with 10 of them in CA

	- Here's [an article about one in Riverside](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/california-bears-the-painful-scars-of-native-american-boarding-schools/)

	- This was also used extensively in Canada

---

### Be careful with narratives of 'extinct' languages

- Languages often do not 'die naturally'

- People still exist who know them and know of them

- Nothing is lost that is not forgotten, and Indigenous people are still here

	- The process is not over

- Do not let the people who tried to kill these groups claim to mourn and move on

---

## Language Families of Amazonas

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/amazonas_langs.jpg">  

---

## Language Families of the Caucasus

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/caucasianmap.png">  

---

Wow... that's a lot of language families!

- ### Do all languages have relatives?

---

# Do all languages have relatives?

---

### Yes, but we don't always know what they are!

---

## Linguistic Isolates

Languages where we have found no contemporary relatives or ancestors

---

### Basque

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/basqueregion.jpg"> 

---

### Other well-known(ish) isolates

* Ainu (spoken in Japan)

* Karok (spoken in California)

* Korean (spoken in Korea)

* Natchez (spoken in MS/LA, now OK)

* Zuni (spoken in New Mexico)

---

# ... but aren't all languages related?

---

### "Proto Human"/"Proto World"

The postulated human mother-tongue

---

### Proto-World is mostly the domain of crackpots

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/crackpot.jpg"> 

---

### Proto-World

- This requires reconstructing based on reconstruction

- No written records have been found to exist

	- lol.

- This makes the assumption that humans only developed language once!

---

### Wrapping Up

* 'Language' vs. 'Dialect' is political, not linguistic

* Dialects of a 'mother language' which grow apart become 'daughter languages'

* This begets 'language families'

* We find these relations by looking for cognates, sound correspondences, shared features, and by doing reconstruction

* We can't always find relatives for languages.

## Case Systems

---

### Grammatical Relations

How a language marks who did what to whom

---

### English uses word order to mark grammatical relations.

- ... but that's not the only way!

---

## Case Marking

- Use of inflectional morphemes to mark Grammatical Relations

---

### Russian has case markers

* Each case marker corresponds to a grammatical role

* **Nominative Case** - "The Subject"

* **Accusative Case** - "The Object"

---

### Russian Case Marking

- sobaka vidye-la koshk-u
- dog.NOM see-SG.FEM.PST cat-ACC.FEM
- "The dog saw the cat."

- koshka vidye-la sobak-u 
- cat.NOM see-SG.FEM.PST dog-ACC.FEM
- "The cat saw the dog."

---

### Russian Case Marking

- Ya tyebya vizh-u
- I.NOM you.ACC see-1SG
- "I see you"

- Ti myenya vid-ish
- you.NOM I.ACC see-2SG
- "You see me"

---

### If we put the sentence "Niloo hugged the turtle" into Russian, the proper cases would be...

A) Niloo - NOM, Turtle - ACC

B) Niloo - ACC, Turtle - NOM

C) Niloo - NOM, Turtle - NOM

D) Niloo - ACC, Turtle - ACC

---

### If we put the sentence "Niloo hugged the turtle" into Russian, the proper cases would be...

A) <correct>Niloo - NOM, Turtle - ACC</correct>

B) Niloo - ACC, Turtle - NOM

C) Niloo - NOM, Turtle - NOM

D) Niloo - ACC, Turtle - ACC

---

### In Russian, Word order can be used for Pragmatics

* Koshka videla sobaku
	* "The cat saw the dog"

* Videla koshka sobaku
	* "The cat saw the dog"

* Sobaku videla Koshka
	* "The cat saw the dog"

- Russian is a "non-configurational" language

---

### English has some case too!

* I see him
* I-NOM see he-ACC

* He sees me
* He-NOM see-3sg I-ACC

---

### You know what other language has case?

---

<lang>Geonosian</lang><br><ldata>??? - Geonosis</ldata> 

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/geonosian.jpg"> 
---

(... and I didn't think I was a linguist)

---

### ... but Russian has more cases!

---

## The Russian Case System

* **Nominative Case** - "The Subject"

* **Accusative Case** - "The Direct Object"

* **Dative Case** - "The Indirect Object or Recipient"

* **Genitive Case** - "The Possessor (and more)"

* **Locative Case** - "The Location (and more)"

* **Instrumental Case** - "The Tool (and more)"

---

### Genitive Case

Marks possession

---

### Genitive Case in Action

* Ya vi-zhu sharik sobak-i
* 1sg.NOM see-1sg ball-ACC dog-GEN
* "I see the dog's ball"

---

### Locative Case

Marks the location of events

* (this is also called the "Prepositional Case")

---

### Locative Case in action

- Ya zhiv-u v Californi-i
- 1sg.NOM live-1sg in California-LOC
- "I live in California"

---

### Instrumental Case

Marks an object being used

---

### Instrumental Case in Action

* Andres pish-et karandash-om
* Andres-NOM write-3sg pencil-INST
* "Andres writes with a pencil"

* Ya yem borscht so smetanoy
* 1sg-NOM eat borscht-ACC with sour.cream-INST
* "I eat borscht with sour cream"

---

### Dative Case

Marks the indirect object, or recipient of an item

---

### Dative Case

* Kevin dayot tsvet-i Lis-ye
* Kevin-NOM give.3sg Flowers-ACC.PLUR Lisa-DAT
* "Kevin gave Lisa flowers"

* Enchilad-i mne da-la Niloo 
* Enchilada-ACC.PLUR 1sg.DAT give-PAST.FEM Niloo-NOM
* "Niloo gave me Enchiladas"

---

### Dative as "Goal"

* Ya pomoga-yu Kevinu
* 1sg.NOM help-present.1sg Kevin-DAT
* "I'm helping Kevin"

* Mne zvoni-l Barack Obama
* 1sg-DAT call-past.masc Barack Obama-NOM

C) Jony - NOM, Dieter - ACC, Pellets - DAT

D) Jony - DAT, Dieter - ACC, Pellets - NOM

---

## The Russian Case System

* **Nominative Case** - "The Subject"

* **Accusative Case** - "The Direct Object"

* **Dative Case** - "The Indirect Object or Recipient"

* **Genitive Case** - "The Possessor (and more)"

* **Locative Case** - "The Location (and more)"

* **Instrumental Case** - "The Tool (and more)"

- *It's actually **way** more complicated than this!*

(Whoa!  That looks like some of the argument roles we saw in lexical semantics!)

---

### So, now you know the Russian system

- Just in case.

### English can handle Nominative and Accusative.

- I saw him

	- I.NOM saw he.DAT

* ... but Dative?  We just can't even.

## Why is it so hard to translate?

---

*Upokoy gospod myortvikh...*

* out-rest-IMPERATIVE God-NOM.sg dead-ACC.pl

* The "u-" means that the rest is "from here".

* The verb is a command, to God.

* The dead are not "recieving" rest (dative), but they're being rested (accusative).

---

*Upokoy gospod myortvikh...*

* out-rest-IMPERATIVE God-NOM.sg dead-ACC.pl

* “God give peace to the dead...” - Constance Garnett

* “May the Lord grant rest to the souls of the dead...” - David McDuff

* "May the Lord grant rest to the dead..." - Pevear and Volokhonsky

* "God rest the dead..." - Google Translate

---

*...a zhivim eshyo zhit*

* but living-DAT.pl still to.live

* The act of living is what continues

* The living are *not* doing the living.

	* Dative means they are "recieving" their living.
	
---

*...a zhivim eshyo zhit*

* but living-DAT.pl still to.live

* “..., the living have still to live!” - Constance Garnett

* “..., and let life be the realm of the living!” - David McDuff

* "..., but the living have still got to live!" - Pevear and Volokhonsky

- "... but still live alive!" - Google Translate (2018)

- "... and the living still live!" - Google Translate (2023)

---

### This ignores connotations not available to us, as well as the conversational context!

- (Bad idea!)

---

### Yпокой господь мертвых, а живым еще жить!

* "God, take the dead and rest them, but those living still are given a life to live"

* **... but that's a *terrible* English sentence.**

---


<section class="clicker"></section>

### Which sentence do you find most pleasing to read and "English-like"?

A) "God, take the dead and rest them, but those living still are given a life to live"

B) “God give peace to the dead, the living have still to live!”

C) "May the Lord grant rest to the dead, but the living have still got to live!"

D) "God rest the dead, and the living still live!"

E) I have no opinion here.

### Accuracy vs. Flow

* "God, take the dead and rest them, but those living still are given a life to live" - Will

* “God give peace to the dead, the living have still to live!” - Garnett

* "May the Lord grant rest to the dead, but the living have still got to live!" - Pevear and Volokhonsky

* "God rest the dead, and the living still live!" - Google Translate

---

### Translation is an art, not a science

* You can't capture Russian nuance in English, and vice versa

* All translations "favor" either the original or new language

	- Learn which you prefer, and use it.

- Good translators know to stop worrying about the details so much and just language

- Translation Theory is the branch of Linguistics that struggles with these issues

---

## "All translations are well-meaning lies"

---

### Doing this analysis broke me

- "How the heck is anybody supposed to translate anything?"

- "Is truly accurate translation a thing?"

- "How could I even tell if I was 'close enough'?"

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/help_kitten.jpg">

---

### So, I took LING 101

- <img class="r-stretch" src="people/zygmunt.jpg">

---

### ... and I declared a Linguistics major

- <img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/more.jpg">

---

### ... and then I took Phonetics

- Then Morphology and Syntax

- Then Phonology

- LIGN 8's Equivalent

- Then Semantics, then Pragmatics

- Then some independent studies

	- This is an option at UCSD too!

---

### Then I realized I couldn't picture doing *anything* else with my life but keep going

- I started looking at Grad schools

	- ... and applying

- [This is not necessarily the right choice for many](http://wstyler.ucsd.edu/posts/linguist_jobs.html), but it was for me

- I got into one of them

	- Only one 😭
	
	- (My application was hot garbage, though!)

---

### I continued Grad School at CU Boulder

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/cu_boulder.jpg">

---

### Linguistics Grad School

- Phonetics

- Phonology

- Morphology

- Syntax

- Semantics and Pragmatics

- Field Methods

---

### ... and whatever else sounded cool!

- Computational Linguistics

- Language Acquisition

- Diachronic Linguistics

- Deeper explorations of phonetics and phonology

- Statistics

- Seminars are a thing!

---

### ... and I attended the LSA Summer Institute

- Every two years ([It's at UMass Amherst in Summer 2023!](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/umass-amherst-selected-host-2023-linguistic-institute))

- Take courses from amazing professors in interesting topics

---

### You'll also be put to work

- As a TA or Graduate Instructor

- Working on or managing research projects

- You'll write large papers, alongside your coursework

---

### Then, you'll write a dissertation!

- A large research project where you need to advance the knowledge of the field (just a little!)

- Mine was ['On the Acoustical and Perceptual Features of Vowel Nasality'](http://wstyler.ucsd.edu/publications.html)

---

### ... and then I got a Ph.D

<img class="r-stretch" src="people/willrebecca.jpg">

---

### ... and then I got a PostDoc

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/michigan_lorch.jpg">

---

### A Typical Linguistic Post Doctoral Fellowship

- Time to work on your own research

- Helping other folks work on theirs

- Advising Grad Students and Undergrads

- Sometimes teaching courses

- Time to get some publications and grow as a scholar

- Time to gain experience for the job market

---

## Linguistics Jobs

---

### Linguists have one big problem on the job market

- *"Oh, you're a linguist?  Cool!  How many languages do you speak?!"*

- Lots of folks need linguists, but very few people know that they do or what we do!

- We're called "Ontologists", "Natural Language Specialists", "Customer Feedback Analyst", "Language specialist", "Translation Director" and many, many more

- Here's [a page from the LSA about Linguistics Jobs](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/linguistics-profession)

---

### What else do linguists do?

- Check out the [Linguistics Career Launch YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJRxM5T1SAtgT6Bhcext2Q) 

---

### Linguists often make great data scientists

- Industry loves Linguists, as we're great at patterns

- Linguists have experience with language data, not just numbers

- This is where [the CSS program](https://css.ucsd.edu/) can help!

---

### Industry loves computational linguists

- Text to Speech, Speech Recognition, NLP, and more!

	- Consider LIGN 6, 165, 167 for this

- Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and more hire and work with linguists!

---

### The Department of Defense loves linguists

- The NSA/CIA/FBI (and more!) want linguists for analysis

- Translation and language teaching like at the [DLIFLC](http://www.dliflc.edu/)

---

### Teaching English as a second language

- Everybody wants people to teach English as a Second Language

- Have language, will travel?  Have job!

---

### Speech Pathology and Audiology

- Speech Pathologists help adults and children having issues with communication, speech, swallowing, and voice.

- Audiologists help test, diagnose, and address many hearing disorders, and work with people to find treatments (e.g. hearing aids) which address their needs and desires.

- Both are steady, well-paid, and in demand jobs!

- For these careers, consider our [Speech and Language Sciences Major!](https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/undergrad/majors/speech-language/index.html)

---

### Academic Positions

- PostDocs are increasingly common

- Also administrative and lab-management positions

- ... but lots of folks want to be a Tenure-Track Professor

---

### As a Professor...

- You have job security (if you don't screw up!)

- You'll do research

- You'll teach

- You'll do administrative stuff

- You'll fight for grant money

- ... but you'll do all of it in pursuit of a field you love

---

### There's one problem with planning to be a professor...

---

### The Linguistics Academic Job Market

<img class="wide" src="humorimg/hell.jpg">

---

### The Academic Job Market is tough

- There will be 2-5 jobs per year in your subfield at well-known schools.  Total.
	
- Competition is fierce
	
	- Jobs have 100+ Applicants
	- ~10 get online interviews
	- 3-6 visit campus
	- 1 job!
	
- You have to love teaching

	- Research-only jobs are very rare
	
- "Wait your turn, you only need one job"

	- ... but boy, that sucks.
	
---

### It's not an easy path 

- You're going where the work is

	- I hope your people are mobile!

- You need to be able to tread water for a few years

- You're taking a vow of fiscal renunciation during Grad School

	- ... and you'll make more money in industry than as a professor

---

### After four long years on the job market, there I was

- <img width="400px" src="people/will_classroom.jpg">

---

### ... and I love it

---
### Your life may not be like mine

- You may choose industry over academia

- You may choose to pursue Linguistics as a component of a different career elsewhere

- You may combine your love of Language with your love of something else

- You may even be able to convince yourself that you're not a linguist

---

### ... but it could be

- Maybe you'll go down the rabbit hole

- Maybe this class will do for you what 101 did for me

- ... and you'll see the true beauty of language

---

### You've come a long way in this class

- ... but one thing is for sure

---

### In the future, you'll all need to do linguistic analysis

- Perhaps as part of your teaching or research, if you decide to go the academic route

- Maybe in industry or defense, if that's your path

- Maybe for fun, on the weekends

	- ... and during the week
	
- You'll want to do it well!

# The Secret to Great Linguistic Analysis

---

### Most linguistics students don't learn this until graduate school

- Many not until a post-doc

- Some, not until they're full professors

- Some poor souls never figure it out!

- **... but you'll know it today!**

---

### We'll end the class like we've lived the class, staring at data!

- *To discover the secret to Great Linguistic Analysis, you'll need to figure out...*

### What is the Russian morpheme marking first person (e.g. 'I do _____') for these verbs?

### That's the secret, right there

- That morpheme

- As you go forward in your linguistic career, remember that...

---

# The secret to great linguistic analysis was /ju/ all along!

---

### Go forth and do great analysis

- ... and see the beauty of language

- Wherever you may go
