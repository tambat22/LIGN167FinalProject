# Phonology: The Sound Patterns of Language are really, really awesome

### Will Styler - LIGN 101

### Today's Plan

- Signed language Phonology

- Syllables are fun

- Phonotactics

- Phonology Q/A

- Language Background

---

## Signed Language Phonology

---

### Phonology isn't just for spoken languages

- Signed languages have phonology too!

---

### Signed languages have parameters

- Handshape

- Orientation

- Movement

- Location

- Expression

---

### All of these parameters can participate in rules and natural classes

- They act just like phonetic features (e.g. velar, voiced, stop, fricative)

- Assimilation/Dissimilation/Epenthesis/Deletion of gestures

- Similar approaches to rule-writing can describe the process

	- Feature -> Variant / [context]_ 

- The *exact same* principles and approaches apply

- Minimal pairs are also a thing!

### WHITE - LIKE

---

### PAPER - CHEESE

<img class="small" src="img/asl_paper.gif"><img class="small" src="img/asl_cheese.gif">

---

### There is one big difference!

- Parameters in sign are often Simultaneous

	- Spoken language is mostly sequential, with sequences of sounds

- Signed language involves many simultaneous parameters affecting one another

- This leads to interesting dimensionality in interactions

---

### Signed language is language

- Damnit

---

# Syllables

---

### Syllables seem to be pretty important in some languages

- English is among them.

- English speakers have an intuitive sense of syllables

---

### Let's try

- Under

    - /ʌn.dəɹ/

- Decoagulate

    - /di.kow.æg.ju.lejt/

- Antipenultimate

    - /æn.ti.pɛ.nʌl.tɪm.ɪt/

---

### Linguists break the syllable into three parts

---

### Phonological rules will often reference syllables

- English /l/ becomes [ɫ] in the coda position

- /ɛ/ is illegal in words without a coda in English

- Spanish will often re-syllabify words to turn codas into onsets

    - "Van a gritar a las olas" ('They will yell at the waves')

- **So, they're good to think about!**

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### In the word 'star', the coda is...

A) /st/

B) /a/

C) /ɹ/

D) /aɹ/

E) /taɹ/

---

### In the word 'star', the coda is...

A) /st/

B) /a/

C) <correct>/ɹ/</correct>

D) /aɹ/

E) /taɹ/

---

### English Aspiration

- We've been ignoring this all quarter

- But there's more to /t/ than [t]

### /t/ is aspirated at the start of a syllable!

- ... not just in the onset!

- So are /p/ and /k/

- Those sounds share a feature!

- They're a *natural class*

---

### The English [d] is the same sound as the Spanish [t]

---

### Different languages have different syllable structures

- This is an important element of...

---

# Phonotactics

---

### Phonotactics

The study of what sounds and combinations of sounds are 'legal' in a language

---

### Every language has a set of phonemes which are used

- This is called a language's **Phonemic Inventory**

    - Sometimes 'phonological inventory'

- Every language has one.

    - ... and you can find it [at PHOIBLE](https://phoible.org/)

---

### A language's phonological inventory is important!

- It tells you which phonemes are legal to use

- It tells you what the 'options' are when there are alternations

- It will play a big role in your analysis

- It really complicates word borrowings!

### Hawaiian is an Indigenous language of Hawai'i

---

### Hawaiian has an atypically small number of consonants

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonology/inventory_hawaiian.jpg">

---

### How do speakers of Hawaiian borrow words from English?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/enhawaiianborrowings.png"> 

---

### Let's look at some English-to-Hawaiian Borrowings

---

### Iniseka

* Insect

---

### Elepani

* Elephant

---

### hipa

* Sheep

---

### kaioke

* Coyote

---

### Kanakalu

* Kangaroo

---

### Lakuna

* Raccoon

---

### Nupepa

* Newspaper

---

### Mokokaikala

* Motorcycle

---

### Kakalina

* Gasoline

---

### Kelepona

* Telephone

---

### Kolokalaiwa

* Screwdriver

---

### But languages also differ in terms of the combinations they allow

---

### Phonotactic Constraints dictate what combinations are 'legal'

- Some sounds can't happen at the start or end of words

- Some sound combinations can't happen

- Some syllable structures are favored or prevented

---

### English has some weird phonotactic constraints

* End a word with a pronounced /h/ ("Bah")

* Say the /ŋ/ in "ring" at the start of a word. ("Ngöndro")

* End a word with the vowel in "bet" or "book". ("Saké")

* English has "s", "k", "v", but say "Moskva"

---

### So do other languages

- ... and these come into play when we're borrowing words

- Languages adapt words to fit their phonotactic constraints when borrowing.

---

### Japanese requires all syllables to be CV

- This means that borrowing from English (which has no such constraint) is complicated

    - CCCC CCCC CCCC CCC

### English

- 'Able' [ejbl̩]

    - V CC
    
- 'Fun and games' [fʌn n̩ gejmz]

    - CVC C CVCC

### A person's 'accent' is often guided by the phonology of the languages in their language background

- Wait, what is that?

---

## Language Background

---

### Let's think about language background a bit more

---

### "L1" vs. "L2" shorthand

- L1 is a 'native' language which you've learned well, generally as a child or young adult

- L2 is an 'acquired' language which you didn't grow up speaking, but have acquired later on

	- Many levels of fluency are possible

- 'Heritage Speakers' have learned a language informally through exposure at home or from relatives, but may never have learned in school or spoken extensively outside the home

	- Many levels of fluency are possible

---

### The 'Native Speaker' problem

- What exactly is a 'native speaker' of a language?

- Where does this leave bilinguals?

- What about people who learned English as L2, but have used it more than their L1 in their lifetimes?

- What about heritage speakers?

- [See Cheng et al. 2022 for more discussion of this issue](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.715843/full)

---

### More useful ways to think about language background

- Which language(s) did you learn first?

- Which language(s) do you use most often?

- Which language(s) do you feel conversationally fluent in?  

- Which language(s) do you have grammatical intuitions in?

- Which language(s) would you prefer to use in a given context?

- Which language(s) do you identify with, or feel an allegiance towards?

---

### Language background is complicated

- Every person has a rich language background

- This is important to consider as we do linguistic work

- ... and trying to compact it down to one dimension or 'term' isn't a great plan!

---

### Next time

- We'll dive into how words work
